Kelly Somers [00:00:01]
Almost 60 days after it all ended, FPL is live again. We're back to discuss Holland's huge rise, Palmer's pricey tag, some exciting changes, and we even try to pick a very early squad. Surprise. We are, ah, back. Have you missed us? Yes. Less than three days after the final of the euros. Yeah, we'll completely skim over that. It's time to turn our attention back to FPL and prepare for the season ahead. Kelly, summer's back for another season of fun. Knowing me, last minute panic decisions and, um, probably a lot of pain, mainly at the expense of the man you just heard laughing then. Hi, Jules. It's been a while. 

Julien Laurens [00:00:43]
Hi, Kelly. So good to be back. 

Kelly Somers [00:00:45]
It's great to be back, isn't it? And England went further than France in the euros, too. Sam m, how are you? Good to. Good to be back with you, too. Ah. 

Sam Bonfield [00:00:52]
Uh, it's lovely to see you, Kels. Uh, honestly, I feel like we've never really left FPL. We're back. It feels so fast to be back again, but here we go. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:01]
I was going to say it feels fast to be back, but this is like Christmas morning for you, isn't it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:01:05]
I'm so excited. Honestly, I cannot tell you how many. Like, as soon as the prices started dropping, I had a draft where we had about 20 players out, and then I was with just numbers for the other players. I think the draft I'm going to share on here is about seven or eight now, and I've still got two and I can't decide which one I'm going to share today. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:23]
Okay. So we have seen the prices. It's actually been really exciting, though. Jules and I have been away in Germany. We've both been following the price reveals and it is really interesting. I don't know why this year it felt even more interesting, I think, to see the likes of Cole Palmer, Bukay, Osaka, how certain players were going to be priced jewels. It was quite interesting, wasn't it, watching? 

Julien Laurens [00:01:43]
Yeah, it was. It's a reward, I guess, in a way, when you do, when you have a good season, especially for Cole Palmer, when you are so, so good and so amazing, and your price was really low at the start because nobody expected you to have that kind of impact and those kind of numbers, all of that, to just wait to see how much more you will be worth then in the game. So would it go up to six or seven or eight or nine or even more? And for him to go, I mean, almost double the price, Sam. Right. Because wasn't it from five to ten. 

Sam Bonfield [00:02:13]
Or initially, five to ten and a half. 

Julien Laurens [00:02:15]
Yeah, five to ten and a half. So even more than double. Incredible. So I think if you call Palmer, um, I don't know how much he loves FPL or he's involved or committed or not, but it must be. It must feel like a proper good reward to be able to, like, go from. To basically show that everything you've done had an impact on the game for this season. 

Kelly Somers [00:02:33]
Coming from interviewing him a fair few times, I get the feeling he's not an FPL player and it's not. 

Sam Bonfield [00:02:37]
His dad is. I remember saying that in an interview. Yeah, he did an interview, um, a few months back where he said his dad plays FPL quite religiously, so his dad will be happy, I'm sure. 

Julien Laurens [00:02:48]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:02:48]
I didn't know that. And for you, watching even closer than Jules and I and being involved, what intrigued you most and when they were coming out, what stood out the most? That's what I'm trying to say. 

Sam Bonfield [00:02:58]
I think it's the battle of the ten to ten and a half players, because you've got all of the ones in there from last season, the Sakas, the Fodens, although he's nine and a half. Um, you've also got palmer, as we've mentioned. You've got, um, so many assets in there that all come in, in that price point. And last year, and actually, over the course of the last few seasons, we've pretty much always been able to have a three mm draft. We've always really felt like we could have a Harlan and a Salah and then somebody else of that nature. You know, you could put a Saka in with them or a son with them if you wanted to, whereas this season, because they're all coming in at that same price, it feels like you're going to have to choose quite carefully. And of course, with Harlem being the most expensive player in the game ever, having him alongside one premium is difficult. Having him alongside two is nearly impossible. It is doable, but you have to really find the value in the four and the four and a half million players to make that work. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:56]
Do you want to wait to reveal if Harlan's in your squad or do you want to go now? Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:04:00]
I've got one with each, so I've got one. 

Julien Laurens [00:04:03]
You cannot not have him. You cannot not have him. 

Sam Bonfield [00:04:06]
I think. I think there's, uh. I'll talk about it later on, but I have got a strategy that has him for the first couple of weeks whilst everyone else is coming back from their international fun. 

Kelly Somers [00:04:16]
That's a big thing, isn't it? That's a big reason when we're picking these squads, we'll come on in a minute to how to build a squad, um, because there'll be a lot of new listeners listening, um, who want to play as well. But it's definitely something to consider more than ever because a lot of our key assets. I mentioned Bukayo Saka, for example. He's just played virtually every minute at the euros for England and other players. Been off since the middle of May. 

Sam Bonfield [00:04:38]
Yeah, Salah and Haaland M. They've had a lovely break, haven't they? And so for me, that's why I'm so torn between these two drafts, because I'm looking at one that's got Salah and Harlem, but it doesn't have a lot of the other assets that I know I can trust in FPL and that I want to have more longer term. But then I do want to have those two in the early part because they've had this nice break and they've been back with their clubs for longer. So in terms of minutes and starts and that kind of thing, you're more assured of it. The changes in the rules also have a big impact on my thinking with which team I go with. So, yeah, maybe I'll share them both later on and you can see which one you prefer. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:14]
Okay. Yes, we'll hold you to that. Let's start with, um, how to build a squad, then. Jules, the practicalities. It's tough, isn't it, creating a team to fit a budget? Especially, as Sam said, when the big players have gone up, do you put your premiums in first, the must haves, and then fill in around it? 

Julien Laurens [00:05:29]
Yeah, that's what I did this time. I have to say, this time was maybe the hardest since I started playing the game. I found it so difficult. And again, me and Kailis have been. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:40]
Stop making excuses. 

Julien Laurens [00:05:41]
No, no, no. But I was going to say, like, for Sam, she's been. She's been for the last few days and few weeks, she's been able to, like, look into it more deeply than us. We've been at the Euros and really switched our attention to FPL on Monday morning, let's be honest. So I don't have the same, like, time of preparing, for example, than Sam. So I find it really difficult to do it yesterday, during the day, a few drives, one with Haalanda, went without. And then very quickly I realized that you have to have erling Haaland anyway, especially because he didn't go to the euro, so he should be ready to go straight away in this man city team. So, yeah, I've put Haaland, my first pick, obviously, and then Saka, my second, and then after that, around that. That was already a lot of money spent, to be fair, because on two players you've spent already a quarter of your budget. So when you think about it, it was absolutely crazy. And then for the rest, I tried to find some good, uh, budget enablers and some cheaper players that I think could do well in the league this season. But I thought it was really difficult. 

Kelly Somers [00:06:45]
Yeah. Sam, you agree? Difficult. 

Sam Bonfield [00:06:47]
It is difficult, yeah. My general strategy is to put a premium in every position. So a defender, a midfielder and a forward, not so worried about much about the goalkeepers. I'll fill them in as we get to the end, but that's generally how I start a draft and that then allows me to see how much budget I can make, work in each of the positions and kind of spread the love a little bit across the team. Now, I think this season it's harder because if you're going to have those expensive attacking players, and again, we'll talk about the rule changes later, but the changes in the bonus point system would suggest that the bonus points are more likely to go to the attacking players this year than they are the defensive ones. So I'm more likely to want to invest heavily in the forwards and the midfielders rather than go for massive premiums in defence of. In fact, in both of my drafts, they're very light in defence and there's a couple in there that I think you have to have, but outside of that, it's just budgets all the way. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:43]
Do you have to offer flexibility around the different positions and price points as well, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:07:48]
Yeah, I think you do. And I think in seasons gone by, we've seen players who you've invested in in the early part of the season who then you want to move on almost straight away because somebody else starts the season really well. And if you don't have an eight ish million midfielder, it's then quite difficult to get to that unless you've left money in the bank, which this year I think is going to be even harder than ever to do. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:12]
Impossible. 

Sam Bonfield [00:08:13]
Yeah, it feels like it. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:16]
Did it not both of you. I kind of want some. Want you to make me feel a bit better here. Jules, maybe you'll be the one. It was impossible to make a draft in 100 million, like, yeah, uh, that you like. I found which is great. I think this is the one thing I would love to say is I think this is brilliant for the game. 

Julien Laurens [00:08:30]
M amazing. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:30]
Because I think there's going to be so much variance we have to pick between the premiums. We're going all have such different teams. 

Julien Laurens [00:08:37]
You so true. Because last season, remember there was a time where a lot. 

Sam Bonfield [00:08:41]
M yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:08:42]
A lot of the managers had the same players or the same players were very often coming back and we saw the ownership really super high for maybe five, six players that all had 25 plus percent ownership. And I think I can guarantee that once we give the listeners our three drafts, our three squads, for now, I wouldn't be surprised if we just have two players in common. Maybe. Okay, maybe let's say three. Because if you have Saliba, Saka and Haaland, for example, which are some very obvious one in each premium for each line, like Sam just said, but for the rest, I could guarantee that the twelve others are probably all very different, which is great, certainly, to start. Then after that, maybe because of the form of each player, etc. Etcetera, it kind of you get still the similar style of players, but at the start it would certainly be what I think one of the most. What's the words? Varied. Yeah, varied. Drafts that, uh. Or squads that, uh. A lot of people have. 

Kelly Somers [00:09:37]
Sam, are you already thinking about what formation you're going to play as well? Because I'm laughing, but because of. We're all laughing because I think I find this time of the season really nerve wracking. And as someone that only opened the app properly a couple of days ago, the difficulty of this season excited me, but also really scared me and means I'm going to spend a lot of time tinkering with drafts, but because of the budget, because of the fact that these premiums are so expensive, it feels like we use the phrase bench fodder a little bit, don't we? Where you have a player in your squad because they're cheap, because you have to have them, because you've got some of the other big, big players. It feels like I'm going to have quite a lot of bench fodder this time. So I'm going to have to have in my mind what formation I want to play because otherwise I'm going to be playing players that maybe I don't want to. 

Sam Bonfield [00:10:22]
Yeah, I mean, I think the really, really good thing about this season is that in the defence, in particular, the 4.5 and 4 million defenders, there are some amazing picks. 

Kelly Somers [00:10:32]
That was the hardest bit. It was interesting. You said you picked a premium defender. It depends on your strategy and how you first pick a team. I'm all out attack. I like the fun of the attackers and actually we'll come on to it later. But the way the BPS has changed a little bit this season has also played into my thinking a little bit with that too. With the defenders, I was actually like, oh my gosh. Spoiler for later in the podcast. There's some Aston Villa defenders that, uh, are 4.5 million, things like that. And that made me go, why would I put loads of money into the defence? There's one player that I do want, or two actually that I do want premium defenders. But what I'm saying is there is some, like you said there, the fact that there are some really good 4.5 defenders means that maybe I can go all out attack. But you'll probably, when we get to that point, you'll make me change my mind. 

Sam Bonfield [00:11:15]
No, I agree with you. Like, I think that the attacking player should be the priority, but I do think that there are one, maybe two defenders. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:24]
Hold on, what do we count as a premium price defender? 

Sam Bonfield [00:11:27]
Again, I think in this. Well, yeah, Jules, but I think actually in this game, maybe even five and a half. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:33]
Okay. Okay. I have got, I have got a premium defender. 

Sam Bonfield [00:11:36]
Then I would argue that in this game because like Poirot is five and a half and I think that that will be a struggle when you think. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:42]
That there are how many minutes in and she's already mentioned worst surprise. 

Sam Bonfield [00:11:48]
But when you think about how many other players that there are in the four and a half bracket that you could go with who have good attacking threat, I think if you're getting to a five and a half six, six and a half seven defender, then you're in premium territory. So for me, I just think that what probably will happen for a lot of managers is that you maybe have one or two in the six five and a half million bracket and then everyone else is four and a half or four. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:13]
Jules, I think you've just about persuaded Jules. He went from shaking his head, disagreeing. 

Julien Laurens [00:12:17]
I was just looking and uh, yeah, I've got some 4.5. No, 4.55, obviously saliva as my. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:26]
Look at this. I knew he was going, here we go. 

Julien Laurens [00:12:30]
Saliba. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:32]
Can I just say that Jules is on a balcony or outside somewhere in France. So it's okay to be gone, it's okay to be singing the Saliba song, but it's also your neighbors and people around you are going to be wondering what on earth's going on? 

Sam Bonfield [00:12:43]
It's not so early out there, though. That's okay. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:46]
Yeah, that's true. That is true. 

Julien Laurens [00:12:47]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:47]
Ah, it's bright and early here in London. Um, okay. We talked about budget and how hard it is to stretch. We've talked about maybe the different price points and where we're gonna go. Um, why don't we go through the premium, Sam? Because I think that's gonna be key, isn't it? Like, in fact, you go through the players that are premiums and what you think we should be doing with them or how. That's the hardest question I'm going to ask you all season. 

Sam Bonfield [00:13:13]
It's the hardest question all season as to what we should do with them. Because if in theory, like, I can read you a list of Harlan's, well. 

Kelly Somers [00:13:19]
How would you prioritize them? Say how you'd prioritize them then? 

Julien Laurens [00:13:26]
If they play for spurs first, if they play for. 

Sam Bonfield [00:13:28]
They are the number one priority that you could possibly ever have. No, I'm joking. Um, so I think deciding what you're going to do about Harlan is the first priority decision that FPL managers need to make. You need to come to a decision about, are you going to have him or are you going to not have him? Because if you are having him, that's going to make a massive difference to the. 

Kelly Somers [00:13:47]
Just quickly, we're all unanimous here on having him. Are we? 

Julien Laurens [00:13:51]
Yeah. You can not have him. Really? 

Kelly Somers [00:13:54]
Even at 50, Sam, you're not allowed two drafts because you're not allowed two teams. 

Sam Bonfield [00:13:57]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:13:57]
Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:13:57]
What is this like? Oh, uh, I've got draft a and draft b. One. 

Kelly Somers [00:14:01]
Is he in one of them? 

Julien Laurens [00:14:02]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:14:04]
And you lean into the. 

Julien Laurens [00:14:05]
You cannot start the season without Haaland in your team. I don't believe that. 

Sam Bonfield [00:14:10]
So up, uh, until the price, uh, up until they announced the changes in the game with the transfers, which we'll talk about in a little bit. I was absolutely set that I was going to have Harlan to start the season, but now I'm kind of like, well, if I can roll multiple transfers and make changes to my strategy, then I can flip flop around with Harlan all season, having him for weeks, not having him for some weeks because it's so much easier to move budget around. I think the fear will get me and I'll end up with the draft that's got Harlan in it to start because he's had the whole summer off, as has Salah. And so I think going with those two is going to be the priority that I'm going to make, um. And I think those are the ones you're going to have to do because obviously if you can go without Salah, then you can have a palmer or a saka or a sun um, or a foden if you prefer, and that will allow you to have a lot more budget to spread across the rest of your team. I think you're going to have to make some big decisions on Watkins this year because Villa's fixtures look really nice to start the season with the exception of one game week. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:06]
And also, Sam, his point price rise wasn't too bad, was it? Actually, I was quite pleased with that. Were you not? 

Sam Bonfield [00:15:11]
Um, well, I was until I started putting it alongside all the other. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:14]
Oh, yeah, I can't afford it. I can't afford him, unfortunately. But I like that he wasn't. I thought he might go to ten. 

Sam Bonfield [00:15:20]
Yeah. And I think if he had gone to ten, that would have been a reasonable number. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:25]
Yeah, same. 

Sam Bonfield [00:15:26]
But I think having that amount of gap between Haaland and the next best forward in the game makes you think. And I also think when you look at players like Isak, who's coming in just slightly cheaper than Watkins, but nonetheless slightly cheaper, he becomes a really valuable asset. Then you've got the Havertzes and the Richarlisons who come in a little bit cheaper again, and if they're regularly starting for their teams, then you've got some real value in the forward line that you could potentially go for. So, yeah, I think for me it's working out. Is it Harlan? If it's Harlan, then great. But who are you putting alongside them as your other premium? And if you're not going with Harlan, you can have three premium midfielders and still create a really attractive looking draft. Which is why I'm so torn, because the one without Haaland, I love that draft. 

Julien Laurens [00:16:11]
Yeah, of course. But the one without Haaland at that price is what we usually have been able to do, and especially that season with a very strong midfield. If you have Haaland in your team, forget about your super star, studied midfield with four top players all around, eight, nine, maybe even you know, more than that. This is not possible. Not a 15 million for just one player. 

Sam Bonfield [00:16:34]
But then you have to decide whether those four assets are going to outscore Haaland, because that's what you're looking at, Haaland plus the cheaper option. 

Kelly Somers [00:16:42]
Are you not also already looking at who your captain, Sam as well, though? 

Sam Bonfield [00:16:46]
Yeah, because really, if you go with the Haaland draft, with just one other premium. It's him every week. Well, if you've got Haaland and Salah, you can flip flop between the two of those with the captaincy. But if you spread a the wealth across your team and you have an e sac and a Watkins up top, and then you have the likes of Palmer and Saka or maybe Foden across the midfield, which is perfectly achievable without Haaland. You've got five captaincy options that you can play with there. So I think the strategy this year for managers is going to be absolutely massive. And it starts with a decision on Haaland. 

Kelly Somers [00:17:17]
Jules, you've gone with Haaland, then which other premium do you have? 

Julien Laurens [00:17:21]
Ah, so my m other two are Saka and Saliba. I just think Saliva is unpredictable. 

Kelly Somers [00:17:25]
Why did I even ask? 

Julien Laurens [00:17:26]
I know, but like, thank you for your question. It's a great question. 

Kelly Somers [00:17:30]
Um, I'm going to be honest with you. My draft's also got the same three premiums. 

Julien Laurens [00:17:34]
I see. I just think quickly, you know how much I love Saliba. I think after the euros that he had as well, where nobody expected him to start for France and to have the tournament that he had, where he was outstanding, uh, not that he needed any kind of boost because he was already very good, but I think this will make him even better. Everything that he learned during the tournament, the good things and the not so good things against Spain in the semi final, for example. So I think all of that will make him a better player. So Saliba for me has to be there even at 6 million and then Bukay Osaka because he's obviously the star boy. And again because I think what I like from his euros and Kelly, you were obviously far closer to him than us. He started in a difficult way, in a way because the team was not playing well, because he was not playing well. And then he got better and better. And I liked the fact that in adversity he raised his game, he became better and better. The goal against the Swiss obviously was outstanding. So I love that. And I think again that would give him some momentum. Not that he needed it because he was already one of the best, but still, I think going into his holidays and then starting the season with Arsenal, he would be not just very excited but also having learned a lot from the euros and what happened with England overall, especially the good things, but also the bad things, and then that would make him an even better player for the seasons to come. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:48]
I also think that he's 0.5 cheaper than Parma. I want Parma. I really wanted Palmer. I put Palmer in straight away, but I also wanted Saka and actually him being 0.5 cheaper. Sam Palmer was brilliant last season and was a shining light and we all got so much value for money out of him. But Saka Vermeer has got the history of doing it for a bit longer than Palmer. 

Sam Bonfield [00:19:11]
Yeah, but those five decisions are going to be what it comes down to. I think if you can afford. There are other players in the Arsenal team that I think you could go with if you don't go with Saka, so you've got players that you could invest in that are cheaper. Whereas at Chelsea, I look at it and there's Nkunku, who looks like an incredible value pick at 6.5, but can he stay fit and where is he going to play in that Chelsea team? There's a lot of unknowns with Chelsea this season with the new manager, whereas with Arsenal, you know roughly what you're going to get. So if you can't afford to have Saka, you can afford to have Erdogaard. So I, uh, think that you could, with Arsenal, maybe you can kind of try and play around with the Saka pick and you can try and go for somebody else. Whereas I look at Chelsea and I think that is quite a difficult one because if Nkunku doesn't start well, doesn't play in the forward line that we've seen previously, him doing, or gets injured again, as we saw last season, and then he's out for long periods, there's less places to go at that price point. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:15]
Yeah, that's very true. Looking at. I'm just going to run through some of the other price points of the premiums that we've mentioned. So obviously, Haaland Salah's 12.5. Were you surprised at the 2.5 difference between Holland and Salah, Sam, or do you think that's fair? 

Sam Bonfield [00:20:26]
No, I think that that's probably right, because I think at first I thought, this is ridiculous. Why are we having such a big gap between Harlan and Salah? But then, actually, when you think about Haaland last season, what Joel said at the beginning is totally right. Last season we started the game with 92% ownership on Haaland. It's just obscene that we had that much on one player. And it did kind of ruin the fun a little bit at the beginning, because everyone had him, you had to keep him. You couldn't move away from him, because if you did, it was going to really hurt your rank by the time we got to the end of the season, he was still owned by 73% of managers. And that was 21% more than any other player in the game at that point. So again, and I tried, if you remember, moving the captain's armband, um, away from him, trying to do some other stuff to gain rank at that point. And for me, I love the fact that the pricing here is going to mean that you struggle to have both of them and you have to go without one. And that's going to reduce ownership across the game, which is going to mean that you've got more. It should be more fun because not everybody's going to have them. It's not going to absolutely kill your rank if you don't have Haaland in the same way that it has in the last couple of seasons. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:33]
Okay, so Palmer's then 10.5. Saka, ten, as we said son, is at 10 million. Foden, 9.5. Watkins, nine. Uh, Trent Alessandro Arnold, seven. Trippier 6.5. And Ben White is 6.5. So I think there's some real interest in the defence. Oh, sorry. I should say as well, Saliba and Gabrielle, 6 million and Poirot, 5.5. The defenders are intriguing. There's a price drop there for Trent to 7 million. Jules, do you think that's going to be make him quite appealing? Because I'm looking at him, I don't think I can afford him, but I would like to at 7 million. 

Julien Laurens [00:22:05]
Me too. I thought exactly the same yesterday, to be fair. And, uh, uh, as much as I can explain. The price rises for like a palmer and Haaland, in a way. All of that for Trent. I'm not really sure why he goes down. Okay, last season was maybe not his best season, but he's still a really good player. So I welcome it 100% because I think that there will be a lot of managers who think like, yeah, uh, I'll have him. We will have to wait and maybe a few preseason matches from Liverpool on the, on the slot to know exactly. And for Trent to be back, by the way, because he will go on holidays now and he will miss some chunks of the preseason to see how he intends to use him. Is it similar to Klopp? Is it different role than Klopp in possession of possession? What are, uh, Liverpool going to look like defensively and what kind of shape and what kind of structure and with the ball? We see the same for Salah, by the way. I'm not sure Arnislot could rely heavily on Mo Salah. Maybe. Usually he relies far more on his number nine than on his two wide players. So, uh, if you ask me right now, who could honestly, what player Liverpool could benefit a lot from the arrival of honest slot to replace Klopp for me would be Darwin. More than a Salah, surely. Jos, I almost put him in my draft. 

Kelly Somers [00:23:22]
20 minutes in and we're on it, you know? 

Julien Laurens [00:23:24]
Uh, yeah, no, no, but it's true. So I think it would be because let's. Let's remind everybody again, this is very, very early. There's. There's a lot of teams that haven't even played yet. Some have just started training together. Some have not even touched the ball yet. 

Kelly Somers [00:23:36]
Jules, are you going to be watching preseason games as closely as usual? Because you're going to be. I feel like with the changes to the game, you're going to be more important to us than ever. Not that you want. 

Julien Laurens [00:23:43]
Thank you very much. No, thank you very much. I report on you, uh, for UK, on all those friendlies and preseason two amenity. 

Kelly Somers [00:23:49]
Um, as it stands, I don't have a Liverpool player in my draft and that scares me. No, I will, Sam. I will. By the time the season starts, I just didn't know who to have on my first draft, and I need to. 

Julien Laurens [00:23:59]
And you're right, because is it Luis Diaz or Cody Gagpo? 

Sam Bonfield [00:24:03]
They're all still away as well because we've had copper America, so not had any of them yet. 

Julien Laurens [00:24:07]
Yeah, but Avi Hellia could. Arnislott really likes Elliott and makes him a starter ahead of Sobozlai or ahead of. 

Kelly Somers [00:24:13]
I'm basically desperately hoping that slot decides that someone other than M mo Salah is going to be his main man. So it's a little bit cheaper. 

Julien Laurens [00:24:20]
So I wouldn't be surprised. Really. 

Kelly Somers [00:24:23]
There's so much. George, you've raised a really valid point in terms of we've barely seen any of these players play, particularly some of the ones I listed then haven't even been on their holidays yet. Their season hasn't even ended, let alone restarted. I'm going to have to move on because we are doing this in one whole chunk. We're trying not to stop. And we're going massively over, which isn't really a good idea. I think we're over. We're probably almost around 25 minutes in and we haven't even mentioned the changes to the game. I can hear people listening to this, shouting at their smartphones or whatever. They're listening to this on saying talk about the changes. The producer Jessie has just texted me saying, glad you mentioned that because I was about to text you telling you to move on. There you go, Jesse. I'm doing it. 

Julien Laurens [00:24:59]
I need to know about those changes as well. To be fair, I can't wait to hear. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:03]
Jules, we can't cut that out. We've got to leave in the fact that you're admitting you've barely paid any attention. 

Julien Laurens [00:25:08]
It's sort of our talent, planning, and vision. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:09]
Well, actually, what I spent longer looked looking at yesterday because these changes are huge for the game and are going to completely shake things up, in my opinion, in a really, really good way. And I'm not just saying that because I'm doing this podcast. I just think it's really exciting. So three major changes to the best game in the world. Firstly, transfers. In the past, you have been able to roll transfers to allow you to have two free transfers. One week. If you roll a transfer from the previous week, this year, the number of free transfers managers can bank will be raised from two to five. 

Julien Laurens [00:25:42]
Nice. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:44]
I thought you were joking. This actually is the first time you've heard this. 

Sam Bonfield [00:25:47]
He's really concentrating. 

Julien Laurens [00:25:49]
I've never listened to you so much. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:51]
I'm also speaking like a schoolteacher so that you fully understand you will also keep your rolled transfers when you play a chip. So, for example, if you have four free transfers ahead of game week 17 and you free hit in game week 17, you will have four free transfers for game week 18. I think this is the thing that people tweet and instagram me about the most. You know, like on a big double when everyone's using their free hit. People then moan the week after when they've lost their transfer. I think this is quite good for people that maybe don't forward. This is huge actually, as well. So what does this mean then, for FPL managers? Sam? Um, you tell us what you think it means. I think this is huge. Am I overstating it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:30]
No. This is one of the best things FPL has ever done, in my opinion, because I think there's benefits regardless of what type of manager you are. So if you're like Jaws and you plan everything within an inch of its. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:41]
Life, I've got a question. 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:44]
Then it's perfect because you can, like, you know, I was talking before about Harlan and whether you go with him or go without him. And normally, if you want to switch between Haaland and another premium in another position, you have to really think about that and you have to save transfer, and then you have to probably take a minus four to move the positions around. You won't have to do that. If you know that you want to have Harlem for game week five, say, but you're not going to start with him, you can save transfers and then allow you to do that. So I think it will almost kill off taking a minus four, which is going to be a really nice thing moving forward if you've planned, and I think it will also enable you to kind of plan for a longer term strategy. So normally we would say, okay, I'm going to wild card here, I'm going to bench boost straight after. And then we moan after the bench boost that we've got all this value sitting on our bench and we don't want it there anymore. Well, now if you save five transfers going into a wildcard, say you've set got four, you wild card, you come out of that and then you've got five. You can make one change if you need to, to allow you to play your bench boost properly the week after. And then after that you can use all five transfers that you saved to strip all the money from your bench and put it into your eleven. Like, it's really great for managers that have real strategy and planning. So Jules will love it. 

Kelly Somers [00:27:56]
This is where we're going to catch Julian Le Ron out. He had a good season. Last year's rule changes in for him. 

Julien Laurens [00:28:01]
It makes average players like you two easier. It's easier for you, right, to be able to rolled over. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:07]
So then if you are a new player to the game, I also think this is great. Or if you are kind of one of those managers that really intently plays FPL for a few weeks and then goes on holiday for a week and misses a deadline, or Kelly has a baby and misses a deadline, I'm not. 

Kelly Somers [00:28:22]
I'm not having another one, guys, or whatever. Not this year. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:24]
No, but you know what I mean, like there are things that happen in a season where sometimes managers who aren't, um, quite as like laser focused on it as we are just miss something and then that will mean that if you've missed a week, it's not the end of the world. You come back and you'll still have your transfers available to you. So I think it will allow you to pick back up again if you are what we would call maybe a slightly more casual manager or a new manager to the game. I think the whole rolling five transfers thing is just massive because you can move your strategy around and if you can have the patience to save five transfers, then you've basically got another wild card, haven't you? Because five transfers is what we say is the minimum usually that I would want to make in order to play a wild card chip. So if you get to, you know, you've played your wild card early, maybe you've played that in four or five, which normally I don't like doing because I like to hold it a little bit longer, knowing that I can play it there if I need to. And then bank transfers so that I can make some wholesale changes a bit later on. Feels to me like it is going to be absolutely game changing in terms of how I play FPL. 

Julien Laurens [00:29:28]
There were times last season where for three weeks in a row, you would feel like, my team is good. I like the way my team it is. The fixture is good. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:35]
You waste a transfer almost exactly. 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:37]
Second goalkeeper, fourth, stuff like that. 

Julien Laurens [00:29:40]
Now it's obviously a, uh, game changer. It's great. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:43]
Okay, so Jules approves of the first change. Let's see his reaction to the second. This one, Jules. This one, um, I'm not as excited about because we don't necessarily know the impact. Sorry. If you can hear a baby crying, that's my daughter, so. Yeah, sorry. She's distracting me. The second one, Jules. 

Julien Laurens [00:29:59]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:00]
Also, Jules was sent a script, so he could have read this. 

Sam Bonfield [00:30:02]
Should have read this. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:05]
In a way, it's making for a better podcast. We'll let you off. 

Julien Laurens [00:30:07]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:08]
Uh, a mystery chip. 

Julien Laurens [00:30:11]
Yes. What's the mystery chip? 

Kelly Somers [00:30:12]
The whole point of the mystery chip is we don't know. 

Julien Laurens [00:30:14]
Okay? 

Kelly Somers [00:30:15]
That's what mystery is. I know English is your second language, but. 

Julien Laurens [00:30:19]
No, I thought you were playing with me. Okay, so. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:22]
So basically this is going to be an addition to the usual four chips. Yeah, we know nothing, Sam and I. No one knows anything more about the mystery chip other than that we haven't even had confirmation of when the chip will become available for managers to use. 

Sam Bonfield [00:30:38]
Um, well, they did change. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:41]
I was going to say. I thought I saw people saying it was January. 

Sam Bonfield [00:30:44]
Yes, they have changed its light, and I should have changed it in the script. That's my fault. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:48]
No, I was gonna say I've definitely seen January, but I'm gonna trust your script, so I'm gonna say that. But it is January. Yeah, it is. 

Sam Bonfield [00:30:54]
Yeah. So, um, it's gonna. They're gonna tell us what it is, uh, in December, and it will come. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:59]
Live early Christmas present. 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:00]
Early Christmas present. And then we'll be able to use it from January. So it will be quite exciting for me. This is like, I'm really excited, but also I'm slightly terrified because I like to plan, and I can't plan for this. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:13]
Jules, what do you want it to be? 

Julien Laurens [00:31:15]
Ah. Uh, that's a good question. But if you think about it, it can't. Has nothing to do with transfers because you would have had the second wild card available already from the start of January. Right. So it can't be that. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:27]
Yeah, that's true. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:28]
You can't, like, you can't. It can't be like something of another free hit because it has to be. 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:34]
Could be limitless, like in the euro. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:36]
Limitless. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:36]
Could it be knowing challenge how? Like last season, it'd be like double points for promoted teams. 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:41]
Yes. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:41]
Great. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:42]
So I'm wondering if it's something like that. I don't. But I literally don't know. I'm literally thinking out loud. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:48]
It would be a one off. So it would just be like. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:50]
Well, I'm guessing. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:51]
So I know what it could be. It could be, like in the second half of the season, for one game week, you can double all your points. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:58]
Yes. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:59]
You have to pick the right. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:59]
I hope it's something really fun like that. Whereas one week, everyone goes crazy. Makes loads of. 

Julien Laurens [00:32:05]
For a purist like me and an artist in this game, as you know, top five k last season. 

Kelly Somers [00:32:09]
Did he just call himself an artist? 

Julien Laurens [00:32:12]
Top five k last season. Have I mentioned that already? Top five k last season in the world. I, um, mean, not just in England or in France. 

Kelly Somers [00:32:19]
Uh, George, we need to move on. We need to move on. Oh, I didn't actually answer. Sam, any ideas what you think it. 

Sam Bonfield [00:32:27]
Could be so limitless? I think is possible. That's when you don't have any budget restrictions for one week. So you could have literally all of the most expensive assets in the game, and it could cost you. Like, it could be that that's in a lot of other. 

Kelly Somers [00:32:39]
What's. We could have like a, uh, Salah, a Holland, a Trent, a foden. 

Julien Laurens [00:32:43]
But then everybody would pick the same. 

Sam Bonfield [00:32:44]
No, but you would. You play it in whichever week you wanted to. So you like a free hit, but it's limitless. 

Kelly Somers [00:32:50]
Okay, let's not get too excited. 

Sam Bonfield [00:32:51]
It could be that. The other thing I really liked in challenge, so I agree with what you said, Kelly. I think challenge is the perfect place for them to look for a. Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:33:00]
Look what we're on you. 

Sam Bonfield [00:33:01]
Yeah, exactly. And the week that I loved the most in challenge last year was the one where every time a player had a shot, they got a point for it. And so you could end up with their massive points. If you've got like, I don't know, players playing against the, you know, Harlan or Darwin or whoever it is, playing against somebody that's going to allow them to take lots of shots, then you could play it. That week. I really enjoyed that week in challenge. That was fun. The other thing I would really like, and I know I bang on about this sometimes, but the all out attack chip was my favourite. 

Kelly Somers [00:33:31]
I used to like that as someone. I mentioned it before, the fact that I don't want to spend much budget on defence. 

Sam Bonfield [00:33:36]
Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:33:36]
The only thing was all attack chip. 

Sam Bonfield [00:33:38]
You played all your attacking assets and you only played two defenders that week. 

Kelly Somers [00:33:42]
But Sam, the fact that they got rid of it suggests that. Would they bring it back? 

Sam Bonfield [00:33:45]
Well, they got rid of it because it was at the point where everyone was going big at the back and everyone complained that they didn't want to bench to like of, you know, it was at the point where everyone had like Trent and we all had like these huge defenders and we all wanted double up time. Yeah, we all wanted to play four at the back. And so then on that week where you played all our attacking had to play two, we were all kind of like, I don't want to play just two. Whereas this time and over the last like three seasons or so, I would have given my left arm to play my all out eight attackers multiple times because I felt they've had better opportunities to return than some of my defenders are. So I'd be up for having that back, to be honest. 

Kelly Somers [00:34:23]
Okay, well, that's probably a bit of a waste of a couple of minutes of the podcast because we're literally speculating. So that doesn't actually help you with any of your strategy for this season. Jules, the third change. Listen up. Okay. Okay, this is change. 

Julien Laurens [00:34:36]
There's another one. Oh my God. Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:34:37]
Have you got that notebook out? I bet you haven't got your proper notebook. 

Julien Laurens [00:34:40]
I don't know, because this is, this is not real. The new. No, not bad that I got from you guys for finishing so high in the world. 

Kelly Somers [00:34:48]
Give him a present. And he doesn't. 

Julien Laurens [00:34:50]
It's from the start of the season. It's from the start of the season. 

Sam Bonfield [00:34:53]
This is the start of the season. The game. 

Julien Laurens [00:34:54]
This is my holidays. 

Kelly Somers [00:34:55]
This is my holidays. Unbelievable changes to the points scoring this year. There will also be changes to how points are, uh, allocated. The moment all FPL managers dream of is the one where their goalkeepers score. Sam just wants her goalkeepers to keep. 

Sam Bonfield [00:35:11]
Just to play the right one would. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:12]
Be nice this season. That reality would be even nicer as the number of points a goalkeeper gets for scoring a goal. It's rising from six points to ten points. This is my favourite change. Everyone's going to get really excited by it, but no, no, no, this isn't the whole change, but it just makes me laugh because I've given this the big I am, but actually how often do I score? 

Julien Laurens [00:35:34]
I was listening to everything you said. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:36]
Um, and then you were like, oh yeah, wait, wait, wait. Patience is a virtue. The bonus points system is also being tweaked slightly. I mentioned this earlier, Jules. In FPL, bonus points are awarded for the players who finish 1st, second and third. For a number of different metrics across the match. They score three, two and one points based on where they finish. Depending on those metrics, as we've been through on the pod before, there are also a number of metrics which make up the bonus points system. You may also hear it referred to as BPS. The metrics to decide those bps are being tweaked a little bit. So this is where you need to listen up. Okay, so saving a penalty will be reduced from 15 to nine bonus points. So if your keeper saves a penalty that won't, it used to literally catapult the mark to the BPS, it won't as much now 15 to nine, so that's quite a big change, really. Then there's new bonus point metrics being added. Keepers and defenders conceding a goal will be worth minus four bonus points. So you could have a defender that's playing really well, getting forward lows, getting loads of attacking bps, but then they can see the goal. So it might make us think differently about those attacking, um, fullbacks. Potentially a goal line clearance will be worth three bonus points, a foul. One will be worth one bonus point. A shot on target will be worth two bonus points. They're the two metrics that I'm looking at that also enhanced me thinking about the attackers. But surely now we're going to be thinking about players that take lots of shots, players like you, Jack Grealish is who win lots of fouls. So that's, that's the kind of takeaways that I took when I first heard about it. George, we'll come to you in a moment. Sam, what did you take from it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:14]
Oh, uh, again, I think this is brilliant because it's going to have to and it should change the way you think about the players that you invest in. So a lot of these changes actually could be quite detrimental to your defenders in terms of the bonus point system because they're going to get punished if they concede a goal. They are also probably the ones that are more likely to give away fouls, you know, because a lot of the time that when you look at the players that can commit the most fouls, they rank most highly a lot of the time. So if they're going to lose point at one every time they commit a foul, that could be damaging for them. And they also don't tend to have shots, particularly not shots on target, not as many anyway, as your attacking players do. So we can kind of then look at how we invest, uh, the chunks of our money and we're already kind of saying that anyway. I think that with the attacking players, the way that they're priced this year, we're more likely to go there. I think what we'll see is the attacking assets more likely to pick up the bonus points. It will mean that we don't get a situation like Arreola last year where he wasn't having a particularly brilliant game, wasn't ranked at all in the bonus points, and suddenly found himself with two because he saved a penalty. And I think that's frustrating for a lot of FPL managers when that happens. What I did go and do, Kel, was, is look at the top ten most fouled players last season. Because if you are going to get a point every time you get fouled, then having players in your team that get fouled will rank them highly in the bonus point system. Now, obviously, some of them maybe are less valuable to us because they don't tend to score a lot of goals or get most starts or that kind of good stuff. But knowing who they are can give you a bit of an advantage in this system. So the most foul player in the Premier League last season was Bruno Gamares from Newcastle. And after that it was AU, um, kudos. Madison McGinn, Saka, Anthony Gordon Paqueta, Konza, uh, who I think is really interesting in my draft and in mine, in fact, in all of the ones I've created so far. But the fact that Konza gets fouled a lot of and is 4.5, that's great for us because he's going to rank highly in the bonus point system. And then Chong was the last one. So I think it's just worth keeping an eye on who will get whose players are getting most fouls because they're picking up extra points for that. And then also who's taking the most shot. So like, Phil Foden would have been absolutely killing the bonus points last year. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:36]
Sorry, Sam. The reason I laughed is because Jules originally looked vaguely excited. As that went on, you could see his poor little brain getting more and more confused. I'm not going to do as well this season because I can't keep up with all these. 

Julien Laurens [00:39:48]
I didn't even understand how the, uh, bonus points were awarded last season, but now even less. So I'm just going to wait and then see what Jules. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:54]
The takeaways are basically the players that get fouled. More players that take shots are more likely to get higher on target. Therefore. Sorry. Yeah, shots on target, Sam. You're right. More bonus points. And then just so when you're picking attackers, bear that in mind. And, um, with goalkeepers and defenders, keep in mind the ones that you think might make goal line clearances and also the ones that you think might concede more goals because that will have an impact. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:19]
Okay, thank you. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:20]
He's not going to pay any attention. 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:21]
He's like, whatever. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:23]
Also something else that we should, uh, mention, the changes to the FA cup. This is like not an official FPL change, but it will impact our season and the decisions. Jules looks scared again. Um, basically this season there's going to be less blank and double game weeks. So potentially this could change our chip strategy. You know, like we save the wild card. Let me get the end. Save the wild card. Free hit and bench boost until late in the season. Maybe we won't. The answer there, I think this is right, Sam, is because there's no midweek FA cup. Is that right? 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:51]
It's because, um, the Premier League ends well and because the Premier League weekends are being kept separate. So like last season when we got game week 29 and it was a nightmare and we had four matches. That just won't happen this year because the FA cup weekends are separate from the Premier League weekends. So we won't see the same, um, m the same impact. Yeah, exactly. So basically what we'll see is that we'll have probably two blanks and two doubles, but they will be blanks and doubles for much, much smaller number of teams. So you maybe get one or two teams that are doubling rather than like last year when we had like eight teams doubling. We're very unlikely to see that. So it will massively change and it should massively change your strategy. I suspect that we might see a lot of managers play their bench boost in game week one. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:38]
Do you think? 

Sam Bonfield [00:41:39]
I. Yeah. Wow, that's good because you you know, normally you would save your bench boost for a massive double game week, wouldn't you? Where, uh, all of your players are playing twice. That's the hope with the bench boost chip. But actually, are we going to get that this year? Because the way that the FA cup has changed, it's unlikely. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:55]
I'm sorry, but imagine me playing a bench boost in game week one. 

Julien Laurens [00:41:57]
And also some players would have, uh, just come back from their holidays and start, you know, they. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:02]
Sam, will you do it just for the fun of the podest? 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:05]
What? Pay my bench piece to get me run? 

Julien Laurens [00:42:06]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:12]
I'm gonna get in trouble here. I've been told to hurry up and we're sitting here chanting at some. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:16]
You two, like, regardless of you two chanting at me, it is a strategy that I am thinking about. It depends on what my team is looking like. If I'm certain that everyone's gonna start in game week one, then I might do. Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:26]
Okay. We are gonna have to move on because I think producer Jesse might just disconnect me very soon. Sam, just very quickly because we don't have time to discuss this, but can you just run through some of the position changes for some of the players? Because that's also something that has a real impact on us as FPL managers. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:41]
Actually, we've not had very many this year. So going from a midfielder to a forward, um, we've got Havertz and Richarlison, the two boys from north London. 

Julien Laurens [00:42:48]
That's right. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:49]
Going from a forward to a midfielder, we've got Semenya, uh, Werner and then Kunku. And, uh, then from a midfielder to a defender, we've got Matson. That's it. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:58]
Lovely. Um, okay, so we had a whole other section there on the fact that Erling Haaland is. Has had a massive price rise. He's the most expensive player in the history of FPL. But we've spoken enough about him. And to be honest, I can't believe we've got, what, over 40 minutes into the pod and we've managed not to reveal our squads. I don't really want to reveal mine. I don't think Jules does either. So I feel like we need a whole nother pod to reveal the forced draft. So, yeah, let's. Let's start with goalkeepers. I found this really hard because I desperately wanted Jordan Pickford or David Raya. But Pickford's 5 million. David Rayer is 5.5. And actually, because of this whole budget thing, I've then had to go down. 

Julien Laurens [00:43:38]
And I think you have to be. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:39]
Careful spending money this season. To me, it feels like if you're going to go for keepers, you probably need to go for cheaper ones. Do you agree, Jules? 

Julien Laurens [00:43:47]
Yeah, absolutely. Two, uh, 4.5 for me. Areola, of course. Paris born and bred, the legend that he is. And then I went for Flecken. The second one, Jules. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:56]
I've got him as well. 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:57]
Why? 

Kelly Somers [00:43:57]
Are our squads the same? 

Julien Laurens [00:43:58]
No, but because I think one of Brentford's, uh, issues last season was that defensively they were not good enough. Which is something that Thomas, um, Frank probably hated so much. I, uh, would expect him to have worked a lot already in his preparation for the new season on that. And I would expect Brentford to be much, much, much better, stronger defensively this season coming than there ever was last season. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:20]
Sam, who are yours? 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:21]
Flecken. Um, and then I had Sanchez because I'm expecting him to start under the new manager at Chelsea. 

Julien Laurens [00:44:26]
Oh, interesting. 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:27]
They were my two. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:28]
That's where preseason is going to be. Interesting actually, isn't it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:31]
I mean, all the Chelsea goalkeepers are the same price, so it doesn't really matter. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:35]
I had Petrovich in originally, and then I just was too worried about who was going to start, so I got rid. 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:39]
Yeah, I went off and, uh, consulted the multitude of Chelsea, uh, experts that I have around me because there seems to be hundreds of them. And they all said they're expecting Sanchez to start this season. So I'm going to be watching preseason carefully. And if he's starting, then I'll go with him. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:53]
Okay, let's go into defence. Sam m, you go first. Hold on, which draft are you going with here? 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:58]
Well, Flecken and Sanchez are in both, so regardless of what I was doing. 

Julien Laurens [00:45:01]
There, can you please choose one? Because you can't just like, go from one to another. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:05]
And also, we don't have long of this podcast. 

Julien Laurens [00:45:06]
Exactly. 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:07]
All right, you two have both got Harlan drafts, right? So I'll go with the one that doesn't have Harlan because then it's a bit different. Okay, um, so I've got, uh, Saliba, vardiol, Konza, Mickey van der ven, and then Davis from Ipswich. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:20]
Okay, Jules, who have you got? 

Julien Laurens [00:45:22]
Right, so I've got Saliba, of course. I've got Ian Matson, uh, ahead of Konsa, because I do also wonder if Villa could play with the back five. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:31]
But he can play that night. 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:33]
He's going to be fouled a lot as well. 

Julien Laurens [00:45:34]
But Konsa would become. But I'm not sure how who fouls him. Well, uh, you misread those stats. Like, why would you foul Konsa? But Konsa played a lot of right back when Matikash was injured in the back four of Vela last season. I wouldn't be surprised if Vela go back three and then he would go to one of the three centre backs and then you could have cash on the right. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:54]
I quite like his versatility. 

Julien Laurens [00:45:56]
Yeah, true. I think Matin is going to bring you a lot of points going forward. Munoz at, ah, Crystal palace, who's been outstanding with Colombia in the Copa America until he was suspended for, obviously, the, uh, semifinal. I've got a lot of faith in Lisandro Martinez, back to full fitness now, was very good with Argentina in Copa America. Played every single game. And I think he's going to make United's defence much stronger. And whoever decided to play with him could be a very good partnership. And then Walker Peters, because I just needed somebody else. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:24]
Yeah, yeah. We all get to that point, you know. 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:26]
Fancy Davis, 18 goals in the championship. Like three assists. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:30]
He's 0.5 more. 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:31]
Isn't it madness not to have him? Surely he is. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:33]
Yeah, yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:46:34]
Davies, don't watch the championship, please. 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:37]
Come on now. Look, I'm giving you some football advice now. 

Julien Laurens [00:46:40]
A left back who scored 18 goals. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:41]
Actually, to be fair, Walker Peters is four points. Walker Peters is 4.5. 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:46]
It's yours. 18 goals and 318 assists and three goals he got. 

Julien Laurens [00:46:51]
Oh, yeah, you just said 18 goals. I was like, what? 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:53]
No, the other one. 

Julien Laurens [00:46:55]
I'll have a look at Charlie. John Davis. What's his first name? Phil Davis. 

Sam Bonfield [00:47:01]
Leaf. 

Julien Laurens [00:47:02]
Leaf Davis. Okay. Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:47:03]
Right. My defense, as it stands, my defense is nowhere near set. I've gone Saliba and Konza. I think they'll stay interesting. Um, I've always been a Gabrielle owner over a saliba in the past, but that's because of their price difference. And I think that will actually affect. I think a lot of Gabrielle owners will likely now move on to Saliba because they're starting this season at the same price .6 million. I would have also liked Benny Blanco, but he's 6.5 million now. 

Julien Laurens [00:47:28]
What happened to like is his time and they raised the price. 

Sam Bonfield [00:47:31]
He was really good last season and. 

Kelly Somers [00:47:33]
He'S had a summer off. 

Sam Bonfield [00:47:34]
Yeah, yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:47:35]
True, true. Yeah. For the. Tonight. 

Kelly Somers [00:47:36]
Yeah. So, yeah, the Saliba and Konza, uh, um. I've gone for Bednarek as my Southampton. Not going to come off the bench because he's 4 million. Because he's 4 million jewels. He's 0.5 cheaper than Walker Peters. 

Julien Laurens [00:47:50]
So he's a good idea. 

Kelly Somers [00:47:51]
Um, then these two. I'm not set on Mark Gahey. I'm, um, completely blinded. I think that he'll get blocks. 4.5 million is exceptional value. So he will probably stay. Although. But I know we like having full backs rather than centre backs, so that, that might play into my thinking. But 4.5 million mark gahey is in there. What a player. And, um, then 5 million I've got Branthwaite. But again, there's a bit of bias there just because I wanted some Everton defensive cover. I think they could defensively. But 5 million is too expensive for an Everton defender. There's better 4.5 if you lock him. 

Julien Laurens [00:48:21]
In when he's still an Everton player and quite cheap. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:24]
And there is also a bigger club. 

Julien Laurens [00:48:26]
Yeah, but his price goes up and then you. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:28]
I've got no, if I've got him now, I've got him. 

Sam Bonfield [00:48:31]
His price is his price. If it. So, he's five. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:33]
His price won't change season. 

Julien Laurens [00:48:35]
He can't. His price will stay the same even. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:37]
If his price can't change for the start of the season. Wow. 

Julien Laurens [00:48:39]
Okay. I like this idea then, Brant. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:41]
So, yeah, that, that was kind of awesome, I think. But 5 million, well done. Still feels quite expensive for an Everton defender. But there's, there's a few. So that's my defense at the moment. There's a few points of movement, but. 

Julien Laurens [00:48:50]
I, uh, write, I'm quite happy with Davies, my favorite championship players. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:54]
I was going to ask you how to spell Lee, but we won't go there for tree. Well done. Um, um, Jules, you midfield? This is going to be interesting. 

Julien Laurens [00:49:04]
Yes. So bukay Osaka we mentioned, uh, then my two other decent ones or good ones are, uh, Anthony Gordon, of course. Because I really think that even if he didn't feature enough for my liking at the Euros, he's going to have that momentum from last season. Great season. Mohamed Kudus. Because now that David Moyes is gone, by the way, I saw him at the Euros in Germany. He shook my hand and said, hey, Jules, you okay? After everything that I said about him last season, criticizing him on every show that I did, I was surprised. But anyway, David, he probably doesn't listen to your shows. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:33]
It might not surprise you. 

Julien Laurens [00:49:34]
Maybe not. Maybe not. David, I miss you. But I think with Lopetegui, West Ham are going to play a bit more attacking football and I think that could benefit kudos. So kudos is there. Then I've got Cloy vert not really sure why. And then, and then I listen to this. So, uh, I put her to no doyle first yesterday, and then this morning I woke up and I dreamt of Archie Gray. And I think Archie Gray at, uh, 5 million could be such a good pick because I think the kid is so good, so talented, he's such an ange guy that he could play a lot and he could have a really good sense. So Archie Gray has, ah, taken her to no doubt's place. 

Kelly Somers [00:50:10]
Interesting, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:50:12]
Well, I had lots of money to spend because this is the no Harland draft. Uh, so I've got Salah followed by Palmer and Foden because I need to have somebody to from cities attack. And then I've got Brennan Johnson as my fourth. 

Kelly Somers [00:50:26]
Um, how much is he priced at Salmon? 

Sam Bonfield [00:50:28]
Six and a half. So he's got some good value in there. And then I ran out of money because my front line is also looking nice. So I've got Harry Winks at four and a half. 

Julien Laurens [00:50:37]
By the way, the only thing on Palmer I would say, is that Enzo Maresca is going to build a team that is far more a team than anything Marcio Pochettino did. So when Palmer shown so much last season, because there was just no structure around him and he had to do everything on his own. Plus depends, I think he's still going to have a great season and he's a great player. But I think Chelsea will be very, very different, certainly collectively, than anything we saw last season. 

Sam Bonfield [00:51:02]
And I think, uh, my other draft that I've got going at the minute, that's got Haaland in it, I haven't got Parma, I've got Nkunku instead. Because I agree, I think that there will be some other players from Chelsea that you can go with. But in this one, because I had the budget, I kind of think, well, it makes sense to go there because then if I'd prefer a son or a saka later, I can move M. 

Kelly Somers [00:51:19]
Mine is Saka and Gordon. I think they're the only two set in my midfield at the moment, to be honest. Gibbs White is my 6.5 million placeholder, but there's some really nice other options at 6.5 million. That's actually why I asked you how much Johnson was, Sam. Um, because he could be another option there. I've got Cole Palmer, but I would be very surprised if I start the season with him for the reason that Jules said I had Foden in there. But because I've got Haaland, I took him out and went for Palmer. But actually Foden's cheaper and so, yeah, I don't know. Palmer's in there as a placeholder at the moment because I would like to have him, but I probably won't. And, um, then I've just got, I can't even pronounce his name. Yom Oliok, who's 4.5 million, uh, from Brimford. Should have spent ages before this pod trying to pronounce that. And he's my 4.5 million midfielder that will stays and he won't be in my squad, but there will be a 4.5 million midfielder because if you've got a Haaland draft, you kind of have to. So, yeah, a lot to be decided on my, on my midfield forwards. 

Julien Laurens [00:52:15]
It's good, though, that you can fit Saka and, uh, one of Foden or Palmer in there with Haaland. 

Sam Bonfield [00:52:20]
I don't think you need a 4 million in a Haaland draft. The cheapest midfielder m I have in my Haaland draft is five and a half. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:26]
But it's because I've got a saka and a palmer. 

Julien Laurens [00:52:29]
Yeah, that's. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:30]
But like I just said, then if I all of a sudden move Palmer down to Foden, that then means I don't need a 4.5. So that's probably why that won't happen. But like I said, this is a first draft. This is a lot of these are in as placeholders at the moment to. 

Julien Laurens [00:52:43]
Kind of move m you need a bit of money in the bank as well. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:46]
I haven't got a penny in the bank. 

Sam Bonfield [00:52:48]
How much you got in the bank? 

Julien Laurens [00:52:50]
Plus zero? Five. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:51]
Uh oh. Okay. That's what you're gonna say. 3 million in the way. You right? Coming then. 

Sam Bonfield [00:52:56]
Forwards Havertz, Esac, Jal, Pedro. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:59]
Oh, okay. I've got one of those. I also had Isak until I realized. 

Sam Bonfield [00:53:02]
That you, uh, can't afford it. 

Kelly Somers [00:53:04]
Yeah. If I reduce a cole palmer to a foden, then I can have an Isak, but I've got Haaland. Joao Pedro. I think he is so interesting. At least I think preseason is gonna be very, very interesting for Brighton under their new manager. And I've gone for another favorite, Jean Philippe Mateta. 

Julien Laurens [00:53:22]
Ah, so tell me that you're three again. Cause I was. 

Kelly Somers [00:53:25]
Only because he's. Only because he's 7.5 and I couldn't. All of the players that I wanted were like 8.5 or nine. 

Julien Laurens [00:53:30]
So Haaland, Mateta and Pedro. Pedro. Okay. So I've got Haaland and matata, obviously, like Akuna Mateta matata. And also he's gonna win the Olympics with France. Paris born and bred. Thank you, Sam. He's gonna win the Olympics in Paris. I would be there. So Mateta, uh, the goats has to. 

Sam Bonfield [00:53:49]
Be in your starting game. We won. Yeah. That is Olympics. 

Julien Laurens [00:53:52]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:53:54]
I'm gonna get in real trouble here. 

Julien Laurens [00:53:56]
No, he's going to start with his medal on and he's going to play with the medal. Uh, you know, like all those rappers when they come with that big like chunky thing. And then Isak, my third, so Haaland, Isak and Mateta, this is the dream front three. 

Kelly Somers [00:54:07]
Okay. I'm, uh, not sure about Joao Pedro. 

Julien Laurens [00:54:10]
Why are you two are loving him so much? 

Kelly Somers [00:54:12]
Last season he's 5.5, he played for Watford and I'm joking. That's not the reason. Could well be on penalties. Like I said, preseason 5.5 million. He looks great value, but tools. We're four weeks from the season starting. 

Julien Laurens [00:54:26]
Yeah, yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:54:27]
It's literally a month today. 

Julien Laurens [00:54:28]
No, I just love the love. 

Kelly Somers [00:54:29]
Not quite. 

Sam Bonfield [00:54:30]
I also like the moon is pick. I've not got him either, but at six I think he's really good value as well. 

Kelly Somers [00:54:35]
Yeah. So there's uh, it's so interesting because there's the variance you need a 5.5 and you can't quite get to a moon is so, yeah, it all depends. So much of it depends on if you're going for Harland. 

Julien Laurens [00:54:47]
And also, obviously everybody is going to make more transfers, more signings, the big clubs, city, Arsenal, Liverpool, etcetera. And also the less bigger clubs. So yeah, everything will change, Sam, at this stage. 

Kelly Somers [00:54:58]
Any thoughts? If you have Haaland, we mentioned it before, you're probably going to have to capsign him each week. But then I look at my team and I go, well, actually, if Cole Palmer stays, he could be a captaincy option each week, as could Saka. I even don't mind Anthony Gordon as a captaincy option. 

Sam Bonfield [00:55:11]
Well, in my Haaland draft I've got him and Salah and then there are other players in there that I could captain. Like Isak is in that draft, so he's captain. 

Kelly Somers [00:55:18]
You've got a draft with Haaland, Salah and Isak in? 

Sam Bonfield [00:55:21]
Yeah. Do you want me to read it? 

Kelly Somers [00:55:23]
Go on then very quickly. I'm gonna get in so much trouble for getting you to do it, but. 

Sam Bonfield [00:55:25]
So it's uh, Flecken and Sanchez, Saliba, Davis, Howard, Bellis, um, eudogi, but could save .5 by having Mickey van der verne, Konza, uh, Salah and Kunku, Eze, Hutchinson and Johnson. I like this epic. Yeah, I do too. And particularly if he goes somewhere, if he gets a move that he's being muted with. 

Julien Laurens [00:55:45]
And with Olisa leaving. 

Kelly Somers [00:55:46]
They've sold Alisa. I would have thought so. 

Sam Bonfield [00:55:48]
I can't see him leaving now, but, you know, if he does, then we'll see. And then Harlan, Jal, Pedro and Isak. Up top. 

Julien Laurens [00:55:54]
I won't lie, I prefer your Holland drive than your. 

Sam Bonfield [00:55:58]
But I went with the non Holland draft to give some variants on this podcast, Jules, because, you know, I'm nice like that. 

Kelly Somers [00:56:02]
No, but your Holland draft as well. Your Holland draft is pretty impressive. The players, uh, all about if you're going to go for a Haaland draft and Haaland and Salah is impressive. 

Julien Laurens [00:56:10]
Yes. 

Kelly Somers [00:56:10]
Then you just have to. 

Sam Bonfield [00:56:13]
You won't like it because it doesn't have an arsenal attacker. And that's the only thing I don't like about it. 

Kelly Somers [00:56:18]
As long as I've got leaf sacrifice. 

Julien Laurens [00:56:19]
Somehow Davies in it, that's fine. 

Sam Bonfield [00:56:21]
It has got leaf Davis. He's in every draft I've ever made. 

Kelly Somers [00:56:24]
Guys, guys, guys, enough said about Leif Davies. He's not even kicked a ball this season or in the last few seasons in the Premier League. 

Sam Bonfield [00:56:30]
So we've just become his favourite podcast, by the way. 

Julien Laurens [00:56:32]
I mean, with a name like that, I can only love him, right? 

Kelly Somers [00:56:36]
I'm gonna get in so much trouble because this has been the longest podcast ever. Thank you so much. Uh, to everyone. M producing this podcast for their patience, but also mainly to you guys for listening. I know it feels very early in the season. We hope you're as excited about the new season as we are because believe it or not, it's going to come around very quickly. Keep your eyes peeled for all of the preseason updates. Keep your eyes peeled across fantasy Premiere Premier League.com as well because there's going to be loads of helpful info to help you decide if you really do need Harland, which premiums we have to have, and if you do want to have all the premiums in which enablers we should be having too. We'll be back with you throughout preseason with plenty more info on fixture, swings, fixtures, chips and plenty more. And of course, plenty more of jewels, updates from preseason and all his abuse and everything else that comes in between. We haven't been gone for long, guys, but we're back, back. And, um, we cannot wait to be with you for the rest of the season. Thanks for listening. 

Julien Laurens [00:57:30]
