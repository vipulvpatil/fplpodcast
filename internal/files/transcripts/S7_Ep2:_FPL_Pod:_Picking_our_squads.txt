Kelly Somers [00:00:01]
It's time to get serious. We're now back. Every week, as the FPL countdown continues, we reveal our latest drafts. Should we worry about Haaland, we explore enablers and Jules, the Olympian. Hello. Welcome back. Two weeks after we first returned, we are back for another preseason check in. Everyone's forgotten about the euros. Olympic fever has hit. Somehow, even Jules is working on that. And preseason is well underway. Kelly summers back with you alongside Sam Bomfield. Sam, some of us doing some proper work back at home. 

Sam Bonfield [00:00:36]
Yeah, some of us are really super busy at the moment. While others are swanning around France watching the Olympics. 

Kelly Somers [00:00:43]
I've just told a massive lie. I'm not busy at all. I'm having some time off at the moment. M but I say off. I've got my little girl on my own, so that is not time off. Julian Laurent, thank you for joining us, all the way from your favorite place in the world. 

Julien Laurens [00:00:53]
Oh, uh, hello, Kelly. Hello, Sam. Hello, everyone. Yes. From sunny Paris. Really? Where the Olympics are just amazing. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:00]
Can we just clarify why you're getting to be an Olympics pundit? 

Julien Laurens [00:01:04]
I used to be an Olympian, obviously, in many sports, as you know. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:07]
What was your discipline? Come on. 

Julien Laurens [00:01:08]
Uh, so 1984 I did. Listen, Olympic games in Paris. Uh, you need a provision there to give a bit of the accent and a bit of the flair, the handsomeness, all of that. So I'm just providing all of that handsomeness. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:25]
I've just heard you on M radio, so I'm not sure that in the. 

Julien Laurens [00:01:29]
Voice, I mean, the handsomeness. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:30]
Of course, of course. Everyone loves hearing your voice, don't they? Uh, we hear a lot of it throughout the season. The good news, Sam, am I correct in saying now we're going to be back? This is us kind of back every week now, isn't it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:01:39]
Yeah. This is a week break. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:41]
Yeah. Okay. So if you do want to hear that handsome voice of doing the runner, myself and Sam, every single week, we'll be back in your podcast feed. Very, very excited. So much going on. As I said, preseason is in full swing. FPL challenge has also had a reboot ahead of the campaign. And, Sam, it's quite exciting. I'm actually looking forward to getting properly stuck in with challenge this year. 

Sam Bonfield [00:02:01]
Yeah, I'm really excited about this year. I think last year I really liked it, but there were a few things that frustrated me a little bit. Maybe is the right way of putting it, like having to pick benches when I knew I wouldn't need them because I could transfer players out that weren't starting before they played and having a vice captain who never, ever came on as a captain because I could just change out my captain if I needed to. So the changes that they've made, losing the vice captain, not having the bench, the opening four rounds of challenges, I think are brilliant. The fact that it's five aside makes it really exciting. Loving the unlimited one to start us off because it means you can literally have whoever you want. 

Kelly Somers [00:02:39]
Do you know what? Very quickly, just because I think a lot of people maybe didn't get stuck into challenge last season because it started not, uh, the normal starting point, just run through the premise of challenge again. If people are listening and thinking, I'm actually ready to doubly get stuck in with challenge as well as the traditional game. 

Sam Bonfield [00:02:54]
Yeah. So it fits along the normal game really nicely because it uses the same players, the same budget price points as the main game does. Um, but it acts as an almost like having a free hit chip every week. So at the beginning of each game week, you pick your players again. So for the opening four weeks, you'll just pick, pick five players, but it has slightly different setups to it. So, for example, in game week two, it's all out attack, which, as you can imagine from my little tip about all out attack last time, I'm really excited about because I love that chip. Um, and that means that you just pick one goalkeeper and four forwards in challenge rather than having defenders and midfielders. And it's the same in game week four when it's a defensive week and you got to pick two goalkeepers and three defenders. So it's really exciting because it means that you can pick players. You don't have to think about strategy. You can just pick the players that are the best ones for that week and not worry about if you want them the week after. And I also love the fact that in challenge, there's mini leagues now in a way that there wasn't before. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:50]
So we can have one. 

Sam Bonfield [00:03:51]
We can have one and it will culminatively tell us what's happening over the weeks rather than in challenge. Last year, when it first set up, you could only see what was happening in. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:59]
That was what frustrated me, actually, a little bit. 

Sam Bonfield [00:04:02]
Yeah. Whereas now we can have a mini league and we'll be able to track as we go through and, you know, so you'll be able to set many leagues with your friends and your family, but not just see what happens in that one week, but see what happens over a period of weeks or over the course of the whole season, which is brilliant. And, um, you get to earn, um, badges, which, as you can imagine, this, for me, is like, you, uh, can get an FPL legends badge. I really want that really badly. 

Julien Laurens [00:04:25]
What do you need to get the badges? What, when you get a certain amount of points? 

Sam Bonfield [00:04:28]
Yeah, depending upon how well Jules. Jules is even interested now. The competitive sides come out, but, yeah, depending upon how well you do each week and where you finish, you can you get badges for, like, finishing in the top ten k in a game week or what have you, and then you can sit them on your profile. So when you log into challenge, you'll see them and they get stars above them like you do on international football. 

Kelly Somers [00:04:50]
When you win the World cup. 

Sam Bonfield [00:04:51]
So, yeah, I'm very excited. 

Julien Laurens [00:04:53]
Do England have a star? 

Kelly Somers [00:04:54]
Do you know what I was gonna say, Sam? Sorry. I know what's gonna happen here. Why did you mention that World cup? How did France get on in the euros? Jules? Oh, okay, moving on, because I know what we're gonna end up having an England manager debate. If I'm not, and this is not the time or place. I'm really excited about FBL challenge. Sam, as if you don't have and do enough for this pod. Your homework for this week, I think, is to or before the start of the season, is to start us a league. Because then, um, myself and Jules will be held accountable and we will do it. Whereas I think Jules, you and I, probably both guilty last season of dipping in and out a bit. 

Julien Laurens [00:05:26]
Yes. 

Sam Bonfield [00:05:27]
Outrageous. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:28]
So let's be held accountable. And now that Jules has heard he can get stars and legend badges, I think he's very much in. 

Julien Laurens [00:05:35]
Definitely. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:36]
Definitely. Even I'm in. To be fair. Um, that's a bonus. Talking about FPL challenge, if you are listening to this podcast, is likely because you are like us, knee deep in drafts, realizing that the season is going to start. It's almost August. By the time you listen to this, it probably will be August, meaning the season is just over two weeks away. Pre season. As I said before, it's a bit of a roller coaster preseason, isn't it, Jules? Because you can get excited about a player, and then two days later, they can play, they can get injured, they can. Everything feels like it changes a lot. And if you're nothing, a football obsessive like yourself, you can kind of miss what's going on a little bit, can't you? 

Julien Laurens [00:06:11]
Yeah, that's right. And also kels, which makes it a little bit difficult. Not difficult, but to judge those friendly matches. We still don't have the players who went to the euros or the ones at least who went far in the euros and fine Copa America. So there's still none of the England players, for example, playing with their teams. There's no Darwin Nunes or Luis Diaz, for example, or the South American that might play for your Premier League team or the ones that you're thinking, okay, I want to know if, I don't know, Arnis slot again to stay with Liverpool, play so so and so or, uh, not. Because so far, you know, we haven't seen them, they're still on holidays. So it's a little bit difficult. But we've seen Chelsea being very bad. Let's put it out there to start with, really bad under the new manager, Enzo Moreska. 

Kelly Somers [00:06:52]
Don't hold back. 

Julien Laurens [00:06:52]
No, I mean, why? It's the start of the season, which means that if you wanted a Chelsea player again, there's no Kol Palmer, for example. But if you were tempted by one of them and you've watched them in preseason, maybe that can already change a little bit. Your opinion. We saw a good arsenal against Manchester United, where we also saw Lenny Euro getting injured and Rasmus Hoylen getting injured, which is not good, especially if, like me, you were quite keen on Euro being in your team because he's quite cheap. So it's been quite interesting. But it's true that we can't really yet, I think, judge too much because a lot of the key players are not there yet. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:26]
In the interest of balance, when it comes to Chelsea, there it is. Only preseason, Jules. Exactly. 

Julien Laurens [00:07:31]
No, that's true. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:31]
I'm just saying. But Jules hasn't been impressed, as you can probably tell. But that's his personal opinion. Ah. So there's a few thoughts on preseason, but the big thing that everyone wants to know, what are we? Just over five minutes into this podcast now, everyone wants to know how the drafts are looking. Sam, how many versions are you on? 

Sam Bonfield [00:07:50]
I don't know. How many should I admit to at this point? Um, I think this is about 21 now. Genuinely, I think that's where I am. It's been ridiculous. I'm, um, obsessed. 

Julien Laurens [00:08:00]
21? 

Sam Bonfield [00:08:01]
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:02]
Jules. And the reason Jules is sounding shocked. 

Sam Bonfield [00:08:04]
Is because he's on one. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:06]
I was gonna say, maybe there's a few people listening to this thinking it's still a bit too early for FpL. Maybe they're not going to open their app just yet because actually, the man who's on this podcast only opened his app yesterday, didn't he? And he was absolutely rumbled. I really want to rumble him to the public, to the thousands of people. M listening to this because in our WhatsApp group, our WhatsApp group is either used for Jules going, guys, do we have a podcast tomorrow? Guys, what time is the podcast? Guys, I've lost my schedule, even though it's on 37 emails. And yesterday it was, guys, is it normal that my app isn't working? And some straight away was like, well, that shows you haven't done the team yet. 

Julien Laurens [00:08:39]
When we did the show two weeks ago, we, because the show hadn't launched yet, we went on, we want a different way. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:45]
We wanted. 

Julien Laurens [00:08:46]
Exactly. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:46]
Yeah, but two weeks since. 

Julien Laurens [00:08:48]
No, I know, but then I stayed on that and then, you know, I prepared, I was going to prepare for the show. So I, yeah, I went on the app and the app was not working. 

Sam Bonfield [00:08:59]
Id can't you even in my head. 

Julien Laurens [00:09:00]
Already, I had my 15, you know, so even without the app functioning. 

Kelly Somers [00:09:05]
All right, well, I know that from listening and looking at the feedback we got from the last podcast, people are just obsessed with hearing who we've got in our drafts. So should we go through our drafts? Just let people know where we're at? Jules, I feel like yours is the freshest thing, as it was done yesterday. So do you want to go first? 

Julien Laurens [00:09:19]
Absolutely. So my two goalkeepers, and I think we mentioned that in the last show two weeks ago, Flecken and Arreola, I um, think at their price for their value and what they bring, we saw Areola being obviously very good and very efficient in terms of saves and save points, etcetera, last season. I expect Flecken and Brentford to be much better defensively than they were last season. So for me, I know I don't have one of the prime goalkeepers like Alison or Edison, although Edison, we're not really sure about his future. So that makes sense. I think the defense was really interesting this season because we saw Ben White's price going up. So I think there's a lot of, uh, thinking to put in your defenders, which maybe not so much the case before. So I went with, obviously William Saliba, the uh, king of kings. Then I've got two slightly different versions. One with Konza, one with Madsen, one with Vargio, and one with Pedro Poro. So multiple. 

Sam Bonfield [00:10:12]
So hang on, last time you were here, you said I couldn't have to and I had to make a decision. 

Julien Laurens [00:10:16]
I know, but like. No, but. So, okay, uh, Davis, who's uh, Sam's boyfriend, is there obviously 18 assists and three goals last season in the championship. For the people who not like me, don't watch the championship. 

Kelly Somers [00:10:28]
Uh, I was a forced to. 

Julien Laurens [00:10:31]
And I like very much Barco, the young Argentine left back from Brighton who played in the two friendly matches that they had in Japan where Brighton did really well. He's a very attacking left back, very smart, uh, kid. And because he's too pinned and he's still injured, he should start the season. And I think he is looking very good. So those three are uh, locked in. Barco, Saliba, Davis. And then I have to choose between Vargal or Poirot and Konsa or Madsen. 

Sam Bonfield [00:10:58]
Um, so I've had a bit of a change of strategy with my goalkeepers, I think. Um, simply because I'm struggling to find a way to own Saliba and Bardiel in the same team. But it's quite easy to have Raya in my team. So I'm gonna go for Raya, I think between the sticks as a set and forget goalkeeper. And then just put a 4.0 in there. At the minute it's Turner. But Turner's ownership's quite high. And then I worry that he will drop in price. When, when you have a goalkeeper that's not going to potentially play, that's a. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:27]
Really good thing to actually consider. 

Sam Bonfield [00:11:29]
Yeah, I've not thought about that. Whereas there are loads of other 4.0s who are owned by nobody. So I probably will just move to one of them. Unless it looks like Turner's going to get some game time. And then I'll keep, I'll stick with him. But in reality it's a set and forget goalkeeper with Raya. So I probably just will not run any risk of a price decrease on my 4.0 goalkeeper. And then at the back I've got vardiol then because I've got the Arsenal defence covered by the goalkeeper. Which I hate saying. But that's the only way I can manage to have a man city and an Arsenal defender in. I've also got Barco. I think he makes a lot of sense. And obviously Davis. And then my other two are uh, currently Konza and Geahy. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:06]
Okay, I have gone. I've got rid of my Mark Gehy. Which is a bit of a surprise for anyone that knows me because I'm a big, um, Mark Gehy fan. And my defence is currently. I've still got the same two goalkeepers, Arreola and Flecken. Um, I've kept Saliba. But Sam, I'm still, I can't get in a city and an arsenal cover. So at the moment, that's where I'm at with Saliba, but there's no city cover, which I think has to change, really. Uh, Konza, I had Branthwaite before. I've just downgraded to Michalenko. Um, and then I've currently got Cody and Taylor as my other two. But I've got a million in the bank with my team so that one or two of those will upgrade. So, yeah, my defence is probably when in fact my whole team is not very set. But that's where I'm currently at at the moment. Defence is really tricky. It's tough, uh, really, really tricky. I agree with Jules on that because there's so much money we want to put into the attack with all those premiums. So, yeah, my defence is pretty poor at the moment. 

Julien Laurens [00:13:04]
It's just about Konza as well because the ownership is so high. Because at, uh, 4.5, I think. Fair enough, he's a guaranteed starter and that's why I want Madsen more than Konsa. Because I think if Madsen, especially going forward, can provide a lot of assist and those extra points that Konsa won't provide as a centre back, okay, he might score on set pieces, but Madsen is 0.5 million m more obviously than Konsa, but the ownership is lower. And I think I, uh, like the fact that it's slightly differential to the Konsa owners, really. 

Kelly Somers [00:13:36]
It's just really hard to find that 0.5 million, isn't it? So I've got a million in my bank. If I then put 0.5 in going with him over Konsa, uh, I can then upgrade. Obviously, I've got to upgrade another defender. But then I'm upgrading two defenders. I don't know if I'm getting that much more from them. But, yeah, I take your point completely, Jules. If you do have that extra 0.5 million, I think you could be worth it. Go on then. Sam, you go first with your midfield. 

Sam Bonfield [00:13:57]
So, um, not a lot has changed in midfield. Um, I've still got Salah in there at the moment, um, with Brennan, Johnson and then Kunku in the 6.5 bracket. Two of them still got, um, Eze. And then at the moment I've got Harry winks in the fifth midfielder spot. 

Julien Laurens [00:14:10]
Okay, Jules, so Infosaka as my, uh, premium, the starboard, really. I can't have Saka then. I think what I find really, really interesting and I think a lot of people would be like that, is if you look at the 6.5 million midfielders, you've got great choice, but difficult choice to make. Sobos, light and kunku, kudos. Garnacho, Bernardo Silva are all 6.5 and I can't, because I will have Haaland. I can't afford really anybody more. I can't put Salah in. I can't put Palmerin. I don't want Palmerin anyway. So of those that I've just mentioned, I need to, and I just need to pick three of those five. I've got Oscar Bob, who was very impressive so far in the preseason with Man City. It's also because there's no doku, there's no Bernardo Silva. So I'm not sure Bob is going to play a lot in the season, but he looked really, really amazing. So I'm happy to have him there at 5 million, so. And Kunku alike. Despite Chelsea. I was gonna say despite Chelsea struggle. But you would expect Chelsea to get better. They would get better. It's just they have a new manager. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:14]
And also, as we saw last season, even when they are, when they are not performing well, Cole Palmer managed to provide those numbers. Um, so the good players are still going to shine in that team. 

Julien Laurens [00:15:24]
You're right. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:25]
I've got Nkunku as well. That's what I'm hoping for anyway. 

Julien Laurens [00:15:27]
No, but yeah, yeah. And I think. I think it's fine. And again, the good, the good thing, if Enkunku doesn't perform or he's not starting, I don't, for whatever reason, then it's quite easy to replace by another 6.5 million midfielder before and cuckoo drops price or something like that. So I kept kudos and I garnacho before, remember when I said my dilemma between Pedro Poro, gvardiol, Matzen, Konsa, etcetera, is because if I go with the two cheapest ones, so no gvardiol and Poirot and no Matson Bonsa, I can have a million and I can have. Then I can upgrade to Gordon, which I really, this is what I was. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:58]
Talking about before those 0.5s. Is it worth. Yeah. Sam, do you agree with me? Whereas I would go for a Konza over a matzen, just have that better attacker or is that just me m and you loving attack? 

Sam Bonfield [00:16:08]
No, I would absolutely do that. I think the value this year is in the defence in terms of the enabler slots. Like there's a lot of good 4.5 and 4.0 defensive options. And that means that you can invest more heavily in attack, but the other thing we should remember when creating a team is that, like, on paper, you want to create a great 15 because at some point you'll have a bench boost. But in reality, three of these players are going to get benched every week anyway. So having the cheaper options on your bench, as long as they're going to play, makes a lot of sense. So you have to think carefully about the distribution of your budget and, um, potentially leaving some in the bank as well. So that when you get into game week one, those 0.1 changes that happen after game week one, and there will be loads of them, because people go crazy moving things around. After one game week, you want to still have the flexibility to make a change. So having 0.5 million in the bank is always a good strategy too. 

Kelly Somers [00:17:01]
Yeah, or a million. I can't believe I've quite got a million more. Actually, when you look at my team, you probably can believe I've got a million in the hands. My midfield, as it stands is Gordon. I just can't get rid of him. I just think that he's going to have such a point to prove after the euros. I think he was unlucky not to get more minutes in that England team. I think he was so good last season. Eza, uh, just because I think palace are going to be really good under Oliver Glasner, um, having had a few months under him and Kunku, just because I can't afford Cole Palmer, and I think a lot of people are going to lean that way. And yeah, I like kind of what I've seen from him and then I've still got bukayo saka mainly. Mainly probably because I knew I'd come on this podcast and Jules would make me feel terrible if I didn't. No, also because of the consistency. Um, but he's kind of holding. He's not. I'm not dead set on having him at the moment, but, yeah, I think you're going to get value from m him, aren't you? So, yeah, that's where I'm. Oh, and then I've got Harry winks as well, uh, on my bench as it stands. That's my midfield. 

Julien Laurens [00:17:57]
I mean, if people think Sakai at, uh, 10 million is expensive, which he is, really, there's no doubt. And the same could be said about Salah in a way, but Odegaard are 8.5 million. So you save yourself 1.5 million and. Okay, Odegaard last season was not as good for us in the game as the Odegaard from the previous season. That's fair enough. But he can also have a season where he scores 15 and set up ten goals, which would be amazing, especially, uh, at his price value at the start of the season. So if you can't make it work with Saka, Odegaard is still a very good option. If you want an arsenal attacking midfielder there, you get an extra 1.5 million to spend. Or, as we've been saying, to keep a little bit of it in the bank. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:37]
I've got another suggestion for you. I'm going to go first with my forwards because this is what might also change my saka decision. I've currently got Havertz in with Haaland and Isak as my forwards. I originally had Havertz thinking, oh, now I don't need to have Saka, but then I could still afford Saka, so I've just kept Saka in there. Could Jules Havertz be another way of covering off that arsenal attack? Or do you still need a midfielder, do you think? 

Julien Laurens [00:19:01]
No, no, no. I think. I think that's also a very good suggestion. And Arteta kind of hinted the other day again that, uh, Havers would be the starting number nine in this team, despite. 

Kelly Somers [00:19:12]
I saw those quotes and I was like, hold on. And that's actually because I was also between Havertz. We spoke about Ollie Watkins before. We know that Sam loves him. I also love him after what he did at the euros as well. I'm absolutely. I've been blindsided. Like, the euros have completely, like, I can't think of the word I'm looking for. It, like, clouded every decision. I'm so, like, obsessed with the players that did well or didn't get a enough minutes. But Olly Watkins does also have the pedigree from last season. So it's between Havertz and Watkins. But I'm leaning towards Havertz at the moment because it could enable me to free up that midfield second spot. 

Julien Laurens [00:19:43]
Yeah, it is cheaper, too. So if at least, because the question is always for some of those players, it needs to start, right? Because if your first squad of the season players are on the bench, this is not good. And it looks like Harvard, who had a bit of holidays, nice coming back, got married, by the way. Congratulations to him and his girlfriend. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:05]
How is your everything, all of the players lives? It's so weird. 

Julien Laurens [00:20:10]
Listen, it's very important for all the listeners, all the people who watch on YouTube. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:14]
Get the fans. 

Julien Laurens [00:20:15]
Exactly. And happy wife, happy life now misses harvest. Super happy. Kai is going to be super happy, too. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:21]
Should we just check in with misses M. Laurence. She's delighted because I think she's quite far away from you at the moment, isn't she? 

Julien Laurens [00:20:29]
Very true. Um, in Paris for the Olympics. But. So, yeah, so Havertz, I think is a really good shout. And because at 8 million, I think that's his price. He's cheaper than Watkins, than Haaland and then many others too. So go on, Sam. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:45]
Who are you forwards? 

Sam Bonfield [00:20:47]
Havertz is the one that's not in this team that I really want and I've really struggled to get him. Um, at the moment it's Haaland, Isak and then Muniz from Fulham because their fixtures in the opening week. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:56]
That's a bad front three. 

Julien Laurens [00:20:57]
Say that again. Say that again because I was not listening. 

Sam Bonfield [00:20:59]
Um. Harland Isak and we need from Fulham. 

Julien Laurens [00:21:02]
Yes. Okay. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:03]
Go on, Sam. Give us some justification. You look really sad about your fulness. It's making me feel disappointed. 

Julien Laurens [00:21:07]
Don't be upset. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:09]
We like those. We've just told you it's good. 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:11]
No, I like them. I just really wanted Havertz and I can't quite work out how to do it. Well, I can. I have to take Salah out. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:19]
I was gonna say that's the big difference, isn't it, between yours and my team, for example? 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:22]
Yeah. And the thing is that at the moment I want to have a Liverpool player. They're second on the fixture ticker. The fixtures are really nice. And as George was saying at the beginning, like all of their players pretty much are still not back because of their international duties. So the one player that is there and has been there for the whole of preseason is Salah. And so investing in Liverpool and it not being Salah is a bit of a minefield right now. Like, I don't really know who the other midfielder choice would be yet. So Bosla is kind of the one that I've been like, well, maybe he's the right option. And obviously it significantly changes the way my team would be structured at that point. But again, it's quite hard because he's been really important because Liverpool have been playing with the double number ten. Whereas when Darwin and Jota and Diaz and all of these guys are back, there will be some shuffling around and we'll obviously have a proper number, um, nine in that Liverpool team. And then we'll see whether he's playing cebuzzle or Harvey earlier and how that system is, is working under the new manager. Jot is the one that is going to probably be back relatively soon because obviously he went out of his competition earlier than the others, so he'll be the one that I'm watching most to see how he plays. But slot, uh, I don't really fancy the wide players under him. So again, it's going to be just keeping my eyes on Liverpool over the next couple of weeks into the first game week of the season and going from there. I think the decision on Salah is key in terms of what happens with that forward line. Because if I can afford to have a Habbots or a Watkins, then I will. Isak and Harlan are locked though. I'm going to have those two regardless of what happens in that third slot. But he was good last season and Fulham's fixtures are really, really nice. So uh, it doesn't feel like a bad pick given that it allows me to have a draft that has Isak and Haaland and Salah and all of these other players that I want. 

Kelly Somers [00:23:23]
You say Haaland's locked a quote from Pep Guardiola after the preseason friendly. He had some niggles. He didn't feel good and that's why he didn't play the second half. Throwing things into uh, how nervous are you? I'm aware that we're two and a bit weak from the start of the season, but sounds, isn't it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:23:39]
Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:23:40]
There's a bit of time and again we will, we will know a bit more, for example, before next week's show and also before the season starts. There's obviously the Community Shield and you will have a better idea there. I guess if there's a time where you cannot feel great, it's now. If you're Holland, if you're city, if you're Guardiola, all of that. So I wouldn't be too worried right now. If there was the same course and the season would start on Friday or Saturday, then it'd be different. But right now there's plenty of time. They're on preseason, they can have everything they want. So I wouldn't be too worried. It starts to be worrying if that continues until closer to the start of the season. And also let's not forget that he was out for almost three months last season, which is something that was new because his first season of City was injury free. But before that dortmund, he had some little niggles quite regularly, muscular injuries and things like that, hamstring. So you don't want that to come back for Haaland and not being really sure if he can have the no issues or stuff like that during the season. 

Kelly Somers [00:24:41]
Okay, so let's look at, um, our team structure. And we're not too worried about Holland at the moment, but we mentioned on the last podcast that getting your structure right is really important, especially at the start of the campaign, because it's much easier to replace players over a similar price point, rather than having to kind of get money from your midfield into your defence and so on. So premium wise, I think we're all. Myself and Jules are in a very similar place. Weirdly, our teams are quite similar. Maybe this is me copying him now. 

Julien Laurens [00:25:07]
Mine are Haaland and Isak. Like, okay, that's fine. I think a lot of people are gonna have Haaland and Isak. My third one is Darwin, obviously Darwin. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:15]
Tanya, are you kidding me? 

Julien Laurens [00:25:16]
No, listen, listen, because. And Sam made that good point. Yeah, because it's a very important point. Slot and club are very similar. And I think we said that in the last show two weeks ago. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:27]
But they also tend down is scary. 

Julien Laurens [00:25:29]
They're also quite different is that, you know, I talk with my hands a lot because. And Sam was right, she said it earlier about the white players not being as important for slot than they were for Klopp. And I think the emphasis very much on the slot is that number nine, we saw that Feano with Santi Jimenez, and I think we will see the same with Darwin Nunez and maybe using Darwin a bit more like Bielsa does with Uruguay. And we saw how well that has been working lately for him and for them more than maybe what Klopp or how Klopp was using Darwin. And by the way, Darwin rarely played 90 minutes last season, for example, where you would expect slot to actually keep him on the pitch for all the 90 minutes. So Darwin could be reaching. But again, he's still on holiday, so we haven't seen yet. So you can put Darwin now and still change into somebody else. The good thing about the forwards is you've got a lot of them at 7.5 million. So Darwin is Juan Mateta, uh, Nico Williams, Tony Salanki as well, who could have a season as good as the one that just finished. So that's good. I had one in mind. Is Mark Gu okay? We talked a lot about Chelsea already, but he's only 5 million. And if you think that it could be on your bench and stay there and you be able to spend a lot of the money that you would have in a 7.5 million forward instead, 2.5 million that you save then, guy, you might not be a. Ah, too bad idea. Certainly. Uh, at the beginning to start and, um, create your squads. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:50]
I feel bad now that I didn't ask you because that was actually quite interesting, particularly the point about Liverpool. I am slightly concerned. So I'm the only one out of the three of us doesn't have any Liverpool attack, which is. But then I've got double arsenal attack, so I'm kind of like. There's going to be movement. Yeah, it's the sacrifices all over the place, isn't it? But I'm seeing a lot of drafts without any arsenal. 

Sam Bonfield [00:27:10]
It's not a pleasant place to be. 

Kelly Somers [00:27:12]
No, but equally, it's not particularly pleasant being without Liverpool as well. But I think maybe it's the unknown, I think, with Liverpool. Okay. Right. I wish we could put like a little sound effect or something in here, like rewinding back to what I started saying before. Is there anything else that I didn't ask you in that section that you would like to say? 

Julien Laurens [00:27:28]
No, it's okay. I think, uh, you know, your front three is great. Sam, front three is great. Do you want me to repeat that? No, it's fine. 

Kelly Somers [00:27:34]
No, no, no, we're all good. We know. I think the rest of the listeners will have been listening, so we'll know mine and Sam's front three. So as I was saying about team structure, really, really important, our premium strategy, we said last week that we put them in two weeks ago, we put them in first and kind of build around them. So, Jules, you've gone for just Harland. And do we count Guardiola as a, uh, yeah, yeah, Saliba. Uh, yeah. So you kind of got those three premiums. Sam, you've got three as well. You've got gardiol. Um, this is testing my memory now. I was listening, I promise. Guardiol, Haaland, Salah and Saliba. Oh, no, you couldn't afford Saliba. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:09]
Yeah, maybe Ray is sort of in that category in terms of like goalkeeper spends because he's five and a half. So probably in terms of goalkeepers, he would count as one of the premium goalies. 

Kelly Somers [00:28:18]
Okay, so we're kind of, that's our structure at the moment, but yeah, for, same as for me, really. I've got Saliba, but it could become guardiol, and then I've got Haaland. And I would like Salah. Now, the more this podcast goes on, the more. Anyway, I'm not going to start doing live changes, um, on this thing. Should we talk about a little bit? Go on, Jules, you got yourself Haaland's. 

Julien Laurens [00:28:37]
Ownership right now as we record is 36%, which is since he moved to city, is unprecedented. It's so low. There's more people without him now. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:46]
Mhm. 

Julien Laurens [00:28:46]
Than with him. And, okay, last season it was too much because Sam said it two weeks ago, he was on by 75% when we started the season, which. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:53]
92. At the start of the season, 71. 

Julien Laurens [00:28:56]
Sorry. Which is wrong in a way, because the game should not be about one guy. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:01]
That's why it's so much better this season. 

Julien Laurens [00:29:03]
It's so much better. But I never thought that he would be only owned by 36% of the managers at this stage of the summer. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:11]
Do you think that it's still. It's funny, isn't it? Because now all three of us have Harland. Do you reckon actually, by the start of the season, all three of us will still have Haaland, do you think? Sam, I feel like last week you were less set on Haaland than you are now. Yeah. 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:24]
I mean, I wobble about things all the time. Like, at one point this week, I was like, I think I'll do a draft and see how many premiums I can put in and then how terrible that makes the rest of the team look so. But it was never really like a serious team. It was just, how many is it physically possible to have? And you can do a team that has Raya and Trent and Salah and Palmer, Andy, Sac and Harlan, but then everyone else is 4.04.4, the odd 5.5 midfielder in there. So it massively skews everything else. The thing is with Harlan is that, uh, going into game week one, like Pep's already said, the guys that went long in the euros will not be available for the Community Shield and they'll be eased back in. In the game weeks. Now, what does that actually mean? It's very hard to know with Pep because he says one thing and I. It's not clear whether that means that they might come on and just play a little bit of the game or whether they might start in game week one because they've not played in the Community Shield like, we've seen that before from him. And I think if, like, if I knew for sure that Foden was going to start in game week one and then start for the next seven game weeks afterwards, then I'd be more tempted to try going without Harlem because I know I had, um, a certain city attacker in there. But the issue is a bit like with Salah at the moment, we just don't have that security. So the next few weeks are going to be quite key, I think for me right now I can't see me going without Harlan because of Pep's comments about Foden. It's made me more likely to go with him. Unless of course these niggles turn out to be something serious and then, well, blimey, I've got loads of budget to spend elsewhere, but right now I just can't see me going without him. And Foden's ownership is really high. So what will be interesting is do people, when they don't see him, line up in the community shield, then start to switch away from Foden? And do we see a rise in Haaland's ownership at that point? I think we probably will. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:18]
The other thing as well, I mean, make what you want of it, is that what you're saying? But Haaland scored two in two so far this summer. And there's the Julian Alvarez kind of issue a little bit because one is with the Argentina team in the Olympics. So at some point, after going straight there from the Copa America, he will need some holidays. So you're almost guaranteed that Julian Alvarez is not going to be with the city squad at the start of the season. So. And the other thing is, we're not even sure if he will be amongst the city players because there's a lot of rumors about him, maybe wanted more game time and could leave the club or so city don't even have another number nine that they can play instead of Haaland. So I think, I think it'd be very risky not to start with Haaland unless the guy who you select, which is always the same dilemma and discussion that we have. Okay, you can go without haalands, but you have to make sure that whoever you get for him, instead of him perform straight away because Haaland is going to be perform. He's going to perform straight away. He's going to score one two on the first few games of the season. So whoever you go instead of him, you have to make sure that they just are, uh, as good and perform as well as Haaland to make up those points that you won't have because you won't have Haaland otherwise you're going to fall behind already straight at the start of the season. 

Kelly Somers [00:32:32]
I was also looking briefly at Jack Grealish, actually, because he's gone down to 6.5 million this season. He's got a real point proven. He's had a good preseason so far, uh, as well, hasn't he? And he'll be in there from the off. So I actually wonder if Sam, when you talk about Foden and when people realise he's not playing that community shield, all it could take is a good performance for Jack Grealish and all of a sudden that would be brilliant, wouldn't it? Being able to get a Man City midfielder, uh, with the potential and the output that we know Grealish can have in terms of particularly assists. If he has a. Continues to have a good preseason, we could well be looking at him, couldn't we? 

Sam Bonfield [00:33:03]
Yeah, absolutely. And I think that's the thing, isn't it? That preseason is great because it shows us the players that are informed. And Grealish made some comments about how upset he was by being left out of the England squad. And that kind of stuff is really motivating at times for players. So I don't know, I can see him having a good season off the back of that kind of disappointment. I think Madison made similar comments as well and has also been having a, uh, good preseason with spurs. So it will definitely open up opportunities. And I think it's going to be like that this year. We're going to be having conversations about, oh, I can't have saka, can I have Erdogan or Havertz instead? I can't have Palmer, can I have Nkunku or maybe a Jackson instead? I can't have sun, can I have Johnson or Madison? Like all of these big teams with an expensive premium asset in there are other players and Haaland is exactly the same. Ah, at City, you know, can you get a foden? Yes. But can you save more and have a grealish? If he's going to start, absolutely. Eventually. Might you want Rodgery in that position instead? Yes, maybe there are options that you can go to that are cheaper. And I think as FPL managers, that's part of the skin of the game, isn't it working out well? Who's going to be the regular starter? And can I save myself six, seven, 8 million by having that player instead? And if you can, the difference that makes across the rest of the squad, because it's not, and we have to be careful because a lot of people will go, well, should I have Saka or should I have Havertz? Or should I have Haaland or should I have Grealish? But the conversation isn't, is grealish a better pick than Harlan? It's, well, is Grealish plus the distribution of that extra budget better than Harlan and then the other players that I have alongside him. Hm. You've got to see the whole thing as a, ah, not a choice between a premium and a mid price player, but the premium and the players you get alongside and then the mid price player and then the upside players that you can have alongside. And it has to be that conversation that determines what you eventually do. 

Julien Laurens [00:34:58]
Grealish is 6.5 million and Dooku is 6.5 as well. So they really. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:05]
Good shout. So, of course, to enable us to get the bigger players, we need the cheaper players, like your grealishes, your docus, but also the other enablers in each position. Um, just because, as always, we're going to go miles over. By the way, someone tweeted, I don't know if you saw this, Jules. Someone tweeted us saying, tell producer Jessie that if you want to keep talking, you should make the podcast longer. It's great to listen to you guys. I agree. And we tell him every single week, but he won't be told. He apparently knows more about podcasts than we do and knows how long they should be. Yeah, he's actually all right. We've kept him. Hm. This is second season now. We've kept him on because he's all right. He doesn't know what he's talking about. So we try and keep it not too long because we want to fit into people's commutes and stuff. So today I'm determined to try and make this a better, more compact podcast. But like I said, we're going to be back every week, so there's plenty of time for us to talk about more just quickly on enablers. If we just go through each position, guys, and if you pick out your best enablers, maybe in that position. Am I putting you on the spot too much there, Sam? Um. You'll be good at this, I reckon. 

Sam Bonfield [00:36:00]
Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:36:01]
She's got like 100 million draft anyway. With a lot of enablers in there. Yeah, yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:05]
But I need her to narrow it down. That's why she might not be so good at it. So in terms of defence, I think we call the enablers your cheapest ones, your four and 4.5 million ones. Ah, Sam, who's the best picks? 

Sam Bonfield [00:36:17]
Um, I think if you want to go for a 4.0, then Barco, who Jules and I mentioned earlier is a really nice option. There's Harvard Bellis as well, who scored, um, for Southampton in preseason, so I'm not saying he's going to do that every week, but he looks like a decent option as well. I think those are the two 4.0s that I like the most in the game and then the 4.4s. Ah, sorry, the was like, I wish they were 4.4. You're absolutely right. And that's the problem, isn't it? You've got to be careful with the 4.5s because there's loads of really, really good options and people are brutal in the early part of the season for just going, no, I'm not interested. Um, this player not done well and that player's got a goal and an assist and I'm going to go for them instead. So it's almost worth really paying careful attention to the ownership because like I really like Davis but if he looks like he's going to drop a lot or that, you know, because Ipswich's fixtures actually apart from the opening couple of games which are very difficult against Liverpool and Man City, they then have a really nice block of fixtures. Um, I think he is a really good option. And then who you go for in the 4.5, I mean there's a. Of them and we've spoken about a lot of them over the course of time. But the two think have incredible potential this season. 

Julien Laurens [00:37:30]
As I mentioned, Davis's uh, stats from last season in the championship. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:33]
How many did he get? 

Julien Laurens [00:37:34]
18 assists, three goals. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:36]
So glad you were watching. 

Julien Laurens [00:37:37]
No, it's okay. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:38]
What type of goals you scored, Joel? Jules, what type of goals are you? 

Julien Laurens [00:37:40]
So there was two from outside the box. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:45]
That shows that he is like a complete blagger. You are pro blagger. The fact that straightaway you didn't even. 

Julien Laurens [00:37:50]
I went and checked his highlight reel from the. Anyway, so David, I agree with Sam Barko and Howard Bayless. Is that how you say it? Yeah. Um. Great. I mean Lenny Yoro was my pick, I won't lie. 4.5 million guaranteed starter, I think from United. Did well in the game that he played and then that injury which we're not sure yet what the seriousness is, which is sad because I really hope it's not too serious because I think Euro would have been great and I think I. United defence will be much stronger than last season. Even Onana. You could fancy even Lissandro you could fancy, even Luke show you could fancy too. So uh, I'm um, a bit disappointed. So he's not in my team yet, but he could well be instead of a Davis for example. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:32]
Okay. Midfielders. Would you say, sam, this is between 4.5 to six, is kind of your enabler? 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:40]
Yeah, probably in normal season I would say so this season it might even be up to 5.5 because I think you're going to need the budget elsewhere, which means that you're. And I think actually for me, the way that the enablers are working this season, you really need one in the front eight. So you have to make a decision between is that going to be in the midfield or is it going to be in the forward line? And there's great value in both of those positions. So it's quite difficult to work out where you put your cheap option. I mean, in the forward line you've got a couple because you've obviously got the likes of Jal Pedro and Armstrong at Southampton who could be, you know, decent options depending upon Jal Pedro's situation. By the time we get to game, uh, week one in midfield, you've got some nice picks in the 4.5, you know, cows. We've both got Harry Winks. I'm not expecting Harry Winks to do much apart from start every game did get a couple of. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:30]
But that's all you want, isn't it, for position? 

Sam Bonfield [00:39:33]
I don't need. I don't need my. What's the key thing I need from my 4.5 attacking asset? Ah, I need them to regularly start so they that if I need my third sub, because he'll be my third sub most weeks, I need him to be able to come off the bench and get some points. So I just need a regular starter for that team. Ideally, I want somebody that's not got too high ownership so that he's not going to drop in value because that is the worst case scenario that your enabler becomes 4.4 or worst case still with the defenders 3.9 because then you've got nowhere to go with the them. So Harry Winks is currently at like 10% ownership, just over 10% ownership. So he's not going to have. He's going to take a while to drop in price, but he's regularly going to start. Uh, he got a couple of goals in the championship last season. There's the opportunity for the odd goal here and there, but he's not going to do anything spectacular. But he is super reliable in terms of the starts. So that's why I'll have him because he's my third sub. Like, they just have to be, uh, you don't have to purchase. And I think, you know, if you were bench boosting, if this was a wild card team and we were leading into a bench boost the week after, wouldn't recommend Harry Winks at all. But I think with going into game week one where it's just about getting the best eleven that you can and then making sure that the enablers work for you, then Winx, I think, offers that because unlike, um, in the forward bracket where you can't get a starting player for 4.5, you do have a that with the midfielders. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:01]
Is that all right for you, Jules? 

Julien Laurens [00:41:03]
No, no, no, it makes. No, it makes sense. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:05]
It makes a lot of sense and I think that's a really good point. I was going to say with Sam, you have to think what you need from that 4.5, Sam. And I. I'd say I'm not planning on start, no offense, Harry Winks. I'm not planning on starting him at all. 

Sam Bonfield [00:41:15]
No. 

Julien Laurens [00:41:16]
Well, you shouldn't anyway. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:17]
Unless there's some. Unless there's some crazy double game week. 

Julien Laurens [00:41:19]
Yeah, no, no, I get that. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:21]
Yeah. But yeah, I think that's what you want. You just want someone that uh, could provide you a few points. George, who do you think is the best midfield enablers? 

Julien Laurens [00:41:32]
So, I mean, again, the way I look at it, and it's good because it complements well what Sam was just saying. I'm trying to look at players who can actually bring you points, not more than just two for starting. Because Harry Winks might score one goal if he's lucky and that's it in the season, maybe one or two assists. I know I love Harry Winks, but it's just Harry Wings, right? So if you look at again, Oscar Bob, 5 million, I, but I can understand Bob is not going to be a guy. He's not going to start every game like wings will. So I understand. I um, you know, I get that. But if you look at the 5.5 million, for example, where we. It gets really interesting because you've got a dingra there, you've got Minte there, who is the new signing at Brighton, who's done really, really well in their preseason games. You've got someone like hats on Odoi, for example, or even a Langa forest who are uh, two wingers with a lot of pace who will certainly create chances, be in the position to score, to assist, etcetera. You've got Kobi Maino, whose ownership is almost 9% now because he's guaranteed to start. So I know he's 1 million more than the wings, but I would much rather mayno in my team because he's guaranteed to start. And as we saw last season, he scores. He can score goals. He used to be a winger. So the guy is pretty good in the box, technically, and also in knowing what to do compared to another, maybe different filmmakers. M let me think. Maybe like Harry Winks, who's got no idea what to do once he gets into the box for menu, he's different. So I know it's a million and it's a lot of money in the game, but I would much rather having Kobe in my team than Harry. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:58]
But I think everyone would. Everyone would rather have. 

Julien Laurens [00:43:01]
Yeah, no, no, I'm sure. 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:02]
But the point is, is that sometimes you just can't afford it. Like, I would rather have point, uh, at the moment with the team that I read out before, there's 0.5 in the bank and that 0.5 is there to enable me to not have to go early. Like, I don't want to be making a transfer on Saturday night because everybody's going for somebody and they're going to go up in price, and then I can't afford them. And that is the reality of what game weeks one, two and three, up to four probably are like that. People move early on their transfers because they watch Manchester United play on the Friday evening and whoever it is performs really well, and they suddenly decide, I must have them tonight, and so their price goes up. Now, by the time then spurs eventually play Leicester on the Monday evening, there will have been multiple price changes that will have already happened. I want to put myself in a position where I can wait until we're recording this podcast on Thursday to make my decision about who I'm bringing in. And the only way to do that is to have money in the bank. So if that means that I have to have a Harry Winks instead of a menu, that's where I'll go. Because, uh, it's just a budget distribution thing that has to play a part in the strategy that I play with FPL. And I guess for me, that's why I like to look for somebody like Winx, who is never going to set the world on fire, but what he will do is be there when I need him. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:20]
Sam feels very passionately about this. 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:21]
Like, Harry Lynx. Yeah, I mean, his fan club as well, apparently. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:28]
Okay, so it won't surprise you if you listen to this podcast. Now, we're around 40 minutes. We try and keep this podcast at 45. So there's two more sections that we were going to talk about. We probably don't really have time, um, to do differentials is something that we did throughout last season. We had great fun with it. Who won again? Sam. 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:43]
Me. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:44]
Sam won, of course. Uh, he thought about retorting and he was going to complain. 

Julien Laurens [00:44:49]
I was beaten. Yes. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:51]
Yeah, you were beaten. For once, Julian Lauren was beaten, so he's keeping quiet. If only that happened more often. And we're going to do that again this season. Uh, differential is a reminder, if you're a new listener of players who are owned but under 10% of managers. So these guys will give you one player every week who they think you should pick and then we'll have a little competition. Is this the right time of year, Sam, to be looking at differentials, or do you just play it safe at the beginning of the season? 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:13]
Yeah, it's difficult. I think you do want to have a couple of differential picks in there. So you want to have a couple of players that are slightly different in and around the 10 million or less because they are the ones that give you huge rank gain. But also you have to be a bit cautious because if you go without the heavy hitters, like at the moment, the two most popular players in the game are Palmer and Watkins. I have neither of them in my team, and that's a risk because obviously they're the ones that could hurt the most in the opening weeks of the season. So if you're going to go for a very differential team, go into it with your eyes open, knowing maybe you need an early wild card or maybe you need to just be differential across the price points so that you can move players in and out as you need to as they start performing well. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:57]
Okay, we'll talk about differentials a bit more on the next podcast as well. But also something that we will go into in more details was fixture runs. We spoke about it on the opening podcast a m couple of weeks ago that the rule changes mean that now you can roll up to five transfers for the season. I think it's going to see a change in strategy from a lot of people. We'll be saving the transfers up and using them wisely and it will enable us. So potentially all of a sudden, if you can see that Man City's fixtures or Liverpool's fixtures are going to get really, really nice, they're a bit more fixture proof. So that's maybe not the best example. But if you can see a team's fixture run is about to get really nice, you can save those transfers up and really transform your team to make the most of them. And I think we'll see people. Maybe I'm going to ask you about this as well because I know Jules won't have looked this far in advance, Sam, but it feels like you can almost put the season into blocks, can't you? 

Julien Laurens [00:46:45]
That's what I did, yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:46]
Oh, is it okay? 

Julien Laurens [00:46:46]
All the planning? 

Kelly Somers [00:46:47]
Yeah. Yeah. M anyway, we'll let Sam answer this question, shall we? Because that's probably the only input you've got on it. Um, but I think we could see people kind of chunk off the season. Sam. Um, do you think? 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:56]
Yeah, so I mean, generally speaking, let's not, um. Let's not look too far ahead with fixtures. Like look at them in chunks. So six game weeks at a time feels good because a lot can change in terms of form for players and teams in six week period. But ideally you'd look at like five or six game weeks the teams that have got the best potential for returns in that period and you go with them. Um, but then if you do roll the fixture ticker out and one of the beautiful things about the fixture ticker when you see all. Yeah, yeah. This is like. You know what this is like for me, Kelly? Like stuff. This is like the dream. Like I have the fixture ticker, I'll put it on my wall. Um, but you can see that the blocks change. So you can go, okay, Arsenal's fixtures, they're a little bit tough there because they've got these fixtures in them. But then from this week to this week they're amazing. So when you look at them you can go there's like a six or seven game week run for each team where they're just blue fixtures. And if you can target them and know. Okay, well I haven't because this is kind of where I am with Arsenal. I'm looking at it going, I haven't got an arsenal attack but this point I'm going to need one because there's a nice blue run of fixtures in there that I'm going to need to target. And so that's. That's kind of how I choose to use the fixture ticket. You have to take the fixture ticker with a little bit of um. With a little bit of thought of how good the teams are because obviously like the Arsenals, the man cities, teams like that, Liverpool, they've got difficult fixtures on the ticker but they are fantastic teams and they could easily do really well in those game weeks. And like for example, the north London derby, which is going to come quite quickly into the season, turns the fixture ticker. Uh, not particularly nice for both Arsenal and Spurs, but we know there's goals in that game so it wouldn't stop me investing in the attackers anyway. Maybe it is for the defenders. So just use the tickers to pick out little periods of time for each team and know that by the time I get there I want to have invested. And if that means you save some transfers to do that, that would be a really good strategy. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:53]
Here's some homework for the listener. Then you can go on Fantasy dot Premier League.com and take a look at the fixture ticker that Sam's been talking about. It's called the fixture difficulty rating the FDR. You can check out which teams have good fixtures and maybe that will help you make your decisions with your team over the coming weeks. We'll take a closer look in depth next week on the podcast at which teams do have nice fixtures as well to hopefully help you. But this is where we're going to leave it. Just a couple of quick fire questions to end on guys. I know my answers to both of these having done this podcast now, Jules, which players have good fixtures to start the season that you haven't considered so far? 

Julien Laurens [00:49:27]
So say that again. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:29]
Which players have good fixtures? They are not in my team that you haven't considered. So maybe it's, I don't know, a Wolves, a Brentford? Is there a team you just haven't even looked at so far that have good fixtures? 

Sam Bonfield [00:49:39]
What? 

Julien Laurens [00:49:40]
This isn't, I mean, let me look at the fixtures because obviously like this is July 31, like I'm in the Olympic Games. I'm going swimming tonight again with Lil Marchanda, legend by the way, he's not. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:50]
Going swimming with him. You're going to walk, aren't you? 

Julien Laurens [00:49:52]
Yeah, I'm just going to shout. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:57]
She want me to go first here, you do that. 

Sam Bonfield [00:50:03]
So for me it's Everton because uh, their fixtures are fantastic. But I don't know, I just don't know what, I don't know how I do. 

Kelly Somers [00:50:11]
Um, them, you can get a defender. 

Sam Bonfield [00:50:13]
But Kelly defensively last season apart from Branthwaite, and he was only really good because of the, the attacking potential that he had. Like I'm not really sure where I'd go there. They're a team that I haven't really. 

Julien Laurens [00:50:24]
Thought enough in the first four games and that's why. 

Sam Bonfield [00:50:28]
But actually when you look at the rest of the ticker though, Jules, after, ah, that, it's like they've got really nice fixtures in and around that. And again, if you're talking about a cheap player, which let's be honest, we are, when we're talking about Everton, none of them are going to cost much money. They're benchable for those two games against spurs and against Villa, and then you've got nice fixtures the rest of the way. Um, and then there are other teams that I kind of think I've not like Manchester United, I haven't looked at at all. Not at all. And that's probably a bad thing because realistically, their season last year was poor and that's put me off investing. But the season before, I had the double up of Rashford and Bruno for pretty much the whole time. So, you know, they are a team that I've not considered owning anyone from yet, but probably need to consider heading into, uh, the opening game, depending upon what we see. I mean, we've got the community shield, so that's going to be a nice opportunity to watch them and make some last minute calls there, Jules. 

Kelly Somers [00:51:22]
Don't worry, you don't have to answer that question. Maybe you can answer this one. Which player don't you have currently that scares you the most? 

Julien Laurens [00:51:31]
Has, uh, to be mo salah. 

Kelly Somers [00:51:32]
Same here. 

Julien Laurens [00:51:33]
Yeah, I don't know. He looked sharp in preseason. Obviously, there was. Was nothing this summer for him. New haircut, too, if you haven't seen it. Uh, maybe that will help. Yeah, uh, I just think. I mean help. I don't know why. Because he was still very good last season. Maybe not his best, but still very good. So it's the one I would love to have, to be honest. 

Kelly Somers [00:51:51]
So how many ones scaring you, Watkins? 

Julien Laurens [00:51:55]
You said havertz and habits, right? 

Kelly Somers [00:51:58]
Uh, that's what we're gonna have to leave it. I just got. Producer Jessie is becoming famous. I just got a WhatsApp saying 50 minutes. I would show you it, but you're not going to see it. Even if you're watching on YouTube, the light won't mean it. 50 minutes with a clock emoji and the red warning emoji. So I'm gonna do what I'm told, and I'm gonna end this podcast because I said I'd keep it to 45. There's just so much to talk about. And, guys, thank you. Jules, go and jump in that pool with yes. 

Sam Bonfield [00:52:23]
Arrested if he jumps in. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:24]
Yeah, yeah. Don't do. 

Julien Laurens [00:52:26]
Gosh, have you seen me swimming? I swim so well, Mandy. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:29]
That's why we've gone on YouTube, purely so people can see your impression of swimming. In case you hadn't heard, we're now on YouTube. So if you've listened to this podcast, he's now doing backstroke. Um, so do go on YouTube to see Julie do butterfly again. 

Julien Laurens [00:52:42]
Butterfly. Then it's all about the legs like dolphins, and then. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:47]
Right. On that note, guys, have a good week. Um, enjoy whatever you're getting up to. Swimming. Whatever, Sam. I hope. Just. Let's just end this podcast. 

Sam Bonfield [00:52:56]
Thanks. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:56]
Uh, guys, we'll be back next week reviewing drafts, everything else, and we'll be hearing what other Olympic sport jewels be getting involved. Thanks for listening. See you later.
