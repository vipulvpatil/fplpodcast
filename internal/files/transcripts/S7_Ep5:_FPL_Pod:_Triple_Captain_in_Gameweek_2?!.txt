Kelly Somers [00:00:01]
For once, we have a pretty happy FPL pod crew. After game week one, we discuss why we think Jota is an FPL gift while we're all remaining patient with our transfers. But could we be tempted to use our triple captain already? So we are underway. FPL for the season 2024 has commenced. I hope you had a good game week. Kelly Summers back with you alongside my trusty pairing of Sam Bonfield and Julian Laron. I'm gonna say it first. I'm bottom of our league already. But of course, it's only one game week, so I'm not too. I'm gonna get it in before you guys do. Jules, I knew you were gonna say it, weren't you? 

Julien Laurens [00:00:36]
100%. That is good. If you start at the bottom. The only way is up, Kelly, so, you know. 

Kelly Somers [00:00:41]
Yeah. The only way is up. It's a steep climb to you, Jules. A whole six points. A whole seven points if I want to catch our leader, Sam Bondfield. Sam, are you enjoying this rare moment at the top? 

Julien Laurens [00:00:50]
Oh, wow. 

Sam Bonfield [00:00:51]
Wow, that was savage. Uh, yeah, I'll enjoy it while I can. Thanks. I'm not starting to move from the top now. That's it. 

Kelly Somers [00:00:59]
I was gonna say, how did your game week one go? 

Sam Bonfield [00:01:01]
Yeah, actually. Alright. I think normally I'm terrible in game week one, but this year it feels like everyone kind of did okay. Because most players actually did return what you were expecting. There was only a couple that I think were surprises. Game week one actually felt. Felt quite good. Yeah, I mean, overall I got 67. I think everyone that I wanted to did well. There's a couple of problems potentially, that I've got now that I'm just waiting on press conferences to find out about, but yeah, otherwise, decent stop. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:28]
Congratulations on only having a couple of problems. I've got a multitude after game week one. Why did I think it was a good idea to go for Barco, who I knew probably was going to lose his place, didn't expect it in game week one. I didn't also expect Quansah to come off at, uh, halftime in game week one. And now I'm left with. I've got a million in the bank, but I'm left with a dodgy defense. No Mo Salah. Ah. Erling, Haaland. At least we all got the captain wrong as well, though, didn't we, Jules? 

Julien Laurens [00:01:54]
We did. I mean, I went for Isak thinking at home to Southampton. You know, the momentum, good preseason, everything. And then nobody obviously could have foreseen Schar being sent off so early. And then Newcastle having to basically not play much for the first half and then be lucky in the second half to score that goal. But at least Isak somehow got the assist for Joelington. So we got five points, which makes it ten. But obviously, if you went for Salah, if you went for Saka, Jota, even, or Pedro Porro, whoever else who had a much better tally than Isak, then you were better off. So obviously the leaders overall are, uh, the ones who went for Mo Salah as captain, for example, because that gets you an extra 14 points compared to others who picked the wrong captain, like us. 

Kelly Somers [00:02:41]
I'm going to also be honest. When I saw Pedro Porro, I was on the phone at the time when I saw Pedro Porro had scored with. 

Julien Laurens [00:02:47]
His back as well. 

Kelly Somers [00:02:48]
The person I was on the phone to doesn't play FPL. And I was like, oh, sorry, Pedro Porro scored and they were like, are you a Leicester fan? I was like, no, no. But I know that two people that I'm playing against in a mini league both have Pedro Porro. 

Julien Laurens [00:03:00]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:00]
Are you worried about him now, though, Sam? He's flagged. 

Sam Bonfield [00:03:03]
He's flagged, yeah, but it was the weirdest injury that I've ever seen because he ran around the pitch stamping his foot for quite a while before he went off, as if he had, like, I don't know, like cramp of some kind. Um, but then there was a moment where Spurs, in a shock, gave away possession and he chased it back and got it back. So I'm not overly concerned. We'll see what Postecoglu says. He tends to be quite honest in his presses. I mean, I only really had Pedro Porro for game week one and two. Anyway, that was the original plan. So if he's out of game week two, then I might think about selling him. But then equally, he was so attacking in that game against Leicester that even if there's no clean sheets, there, uh, there could easily be attacking returns for him over the next few weeks. Just one to wait for the press conferences on, I think. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:48]
Jules, sorry, I only asked you about the wrong captaincy. Other than that, you had some good picks in there. I've got to be honest, I was buzzing when I saw Garnacho benched and then introduced. Julian Laurent, Jammy Fish still gets a return. 

Julien Laurens [00:04:00]
I have said to you, I knew he was going to be on the bench because he had a short preseason because of Copa America. We saw him being on the bench in the Community shield as well, against City. So he was very likely that he would be on the bench. I was not worried about him being on the bench cause I knew he would play at some point. And like I said to you in last week's show, he's really the only good thing going forward for this Manchester United team at the moment anyway. So I knew he would do something coming off the bench. He did. I was so crossed, I missed that chance at the end, literally. Like, even you two would have scored that. So I was just like, how? How did he miss that? And I was shouting at, ah, Rashford, pass the ball to Garnacho. Convincing, convinced that Garnacho would score. So it could have been even better than four. And I expect him now to start at, uh, the weekend because fitness wise, he'll be more ready and I think he showed enough in the two games so far that he deserves to play. So, no, I was happy with Garnacho. Nothing jammy in Garnacho. And overall, 66 points, which is a, uh, decent start. A lot of people returned. And the one who didn't return, like Kudos and Solanke, who we'll talk about a bit later, I felt were unlucky not to return because they were both very good at what they did, just like a little bit. The last in, the last pass or the finishing for Solanki and then for Kudos that the others finished. The chances they created. But, yeah, I thought it was a good start. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:17]
Yeah. 66 points for you. Then you also played the right goalkeeper with Flekken not getting a clean sheet, but getting a couple of points for saves against Crystal palace as well. A reminder, if you haven't yet joined the FPL Pom mini league, the code is q seven y c o, the letter o zero. That's an annoying code because I'm going to have to say that every single time. Clarifying which type of o to put. Um, thank you to everyone who has already joined. Great to see so many of in there. Marjan is currently top. Like I've said, sam, enjoy it while you can. Marjan, only one game week down and he did have a remarkable week though. 98 points, two points off, getting 100. And it's a very red team. He had lots of Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United returning for him. He also put his faith in Garnacho, but his defence. I really liked his defence. He went for Martinez, Saliba and Alexander Arnold. And he also had Havertz up front and an inspired captain, Joyce mo Salah. I wanted to ask you, Sam, if there was any surprises in game week one. Um, for you, because we all try and predict from preseason but we never really know exactly what's going to happen until the first ball of that Premier League season is kicked. Did anything surprise you from game week one? 

Sam Bonfield [00:06:22]
Yeah, I mean, I think there were a couple. I think from an FPL perspective the bonus points have been a bit of a surprise. I think we said in preseason that we were expecting to see defenders not get very many bonus points this time around because of the way that the changes have, have gone into the system and the fact that, uh, you know, you're now getting points for being fouled and you're getting points for shots on target. So we were expecting to see a bit of a change up in who was getting the bonus points and actually it hasn't been as big a change as I thought it was going to be. So no defender or goalkeeper got three bonus points last week. Um, but we did see a number getting two and one. So we had three defenders, um, getting two bonus points and one goalkeeper and then four goalies and six defenders getting one. So plenty of bonus points still to get, I guess, from the defensive players, which is nice because I think when we were all looking at spending like, I went really big at the back with, with Porro, with uh, Saliba and with Gvardiol and I was a little bit concerned about having spent that much money in defence if they weren't likely to pick up bonus points. But the fact that they still got them this week is good. There were some surprises on the pitch as well. Danny Welbeck, we spoke about him in preseason, uh, but had an absolutely phenomenal game. And I think a lot of the chat in preseason was about Jao Pedro and whether, uh, he was the right budget Brighton player to go for. Actually, um, looking back on game week one, I mean, we have to take it with a little bit of a look, uh, at Everton as well, who were very poor, but yeah, 5.5 million, he could actually be a really nice option. It's United up next, but it's their first home fixture of the season and then they've got Arsenal. So there are some difficult games to come for Brighton but actually from game week four onwards, if he's still getting the starts, he could be a lovely pick.

Kelly Somers [00:08:08]
We spoke about it on the pod last week, didn't we? How Jules? Maybe we were all getting a little bit blinded by the fact that we all felt we had to have Haaland Isak and then we got very excited about Dominic Solanke being Spurs number nine going in at the price he was that we were perhaps risking ignoring players, other forwards and he could well be one of those, couldn't he? 

Julien Laurens [00:08:27]
Yeah. I mean, I think it's amazing to see Danny Welbeck with a performance like that. Chris Wood with the performance that he had scoring for Forest and Jamie Vardy on Monday night. Sorry, Sam, but because you're right, uh, not that we don't think Jimmy Vardy or Wood or Welbeck are not good players, it's just that you tend to go with either the bigger names or maybe the bigger teams even. And if you went for the strategy, which is two, let's say superstar strikers or forwards, and then your third one is more of a five 5.5 award, Welbeck Vardy is 5.5 as well. Then you were rewarded this weekend. It might not always be like that. I don't expect Danny Welbeck to score 50 goals a season and have every game like he had at the weekend. But for that game one, game, week one, sorry. It worked really, really well. And I have to say, uh, for Chris Wood especially, I think considering how good he was at times last season, maybe even more than Welbeck and Vardy in the championship, I think Woods was a very smart pick for whoever picked it. Again, I don't think he will last much longer. But for that game week one and for the game that Forest had, for the people who went for him and chose that strategy, it worked out really, really well. 

Kelly Somers [00:09:38]
We did for a while have a third forward conundrum, didn't we, Sam, until Solanke went to Spurs. How did you feel if you take your Spurs hat off a little bit for a minute, how did you feel that he did on his debut at the King Power Stadium? Are you still pleased to have him in your team? Yeah, I think, and I'm talking FPL team, not your team. 

Sam Bonfield [00:09:55]
Well, both actually. I think I'm still pleased to have him there. It's an interesting one, isn't it? I think with Solanke because actually he had a good game, he had plenty of shots on target, plenty of opportunities. Spurs were being very creative, particularly in that first half. Spurs did Spurs things when they conceded and then decided that they forgotten how to play football for a good 25 minutes. But actually I thought Solanke had a good debut and you know, just because he doesn't score in the opening game doesn't mean that we should all panic and get rid of him. I think there were plenty of good signs there from him. So if you've got Solanke he could and, um, should have returned in that game. There were a couple of opportunities where I was like, how, how has he not put that away? And partly that might be, you know, he only arrived a week before the game and it's getting used to new teammates and all of that stuff. So with another week of training together and going into the game at home, which obviously you have the crowd behind you. Then against an Everton side who conceded three, but my goodness, we're unlucky not to concede more than three in that one, or we're lucky, I should say, not to concede more than three in that one. But, yeah, I think Solanke is definitely a hold for me. He played well enough to think that. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:03]
There'S points coming, so don't panic with Solanke and Jules, if you've had a bad start, uh, overall, not you personally, I, meaning the listeners that maybe aren't too happy with how their game week one went, what would your message be to them? Because obviously this season as well, it's not a case that can only hold you transfers for a couple of weeks. You've gone a bit longer now with them. Uh, what would your message be to them in terms of if they're making plans to move players on? 

Julien Laurens [00:11:24]
I'd say don't panic, really. And then you've got a feel about your team. You know, you've watched games, even if it's just highlights, you know, with the players that you have, if it feels like you have to keep them a bit longer and just stay patient, like we've just said for Solanke, because Solanke on the eye had a good game. On the stats, the shots that he had on target, his xg is 0.35. So there was a lot of good things that he did, even if in the end it's two points and he was quite frustrating watching. So you would feel with some of your players, some of your team, if you feel like it's not working out for you, for you, that guy, you don't feel it. So you can change it, you can keep it and roll your transfer like we said, and wait a little bit longer. Some go crazy straight away and play wild cards and etcetera. Or take a, uh, minus four, minus eight because they want to change more. You would think that you've planned for at least a few games at the start of the season before you all started, so that you'd be okay for game week two, game week three, maybe you should not be needed, really, to change too much of your team if you've done it in the right way. So I know, Kelly, you've got a few issues, for example. But overall, I would say don't panic. Usually your squad at the start of the season is okay for at least two or three games. So you should trust in what you picked and why you picked those players in the first place. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:39]
Yeah, I guess the only managers that maybe might have real conundrum, Sam. Or if you've got a defence that consists, uh, of Schar, Konsa, uh, Barco, etcetera, etcetera, if you've got all of those players, then maybe you've got a problem. I've got two of the mentioned there, but I've managed to bench them. And I look at the rest of my team for game week two and I like it. And I am conscious that if I wait a little bit, I can make more changes to my team and it's another week's worth of information. That's also what I think is quite important at this stage of the season, banking up the information from each game week. 

Sam Bonfield [00:13:09]
I think that's the most important thing, actually, at this point in the season is the game time. Looking at the team sheets, who plays where and whether they are in the right position to get you points. But it's very hard to judge that, uh, on one set of 90 minutes. And so being patient with your team is absolutely the right thing. And Jules is right. Like, you make your team selections going into game week one for a reason. Like, you pick these players because you think that they are going to do well over the course of a period of weeks, not just over one game week. And so ripping up your team and starting again, for me anyway, unless you've got multiple problems, like you were saying, like if you've got Barco, who's gone out on loan, if you've got Konsa, who is now a big doubt in terms of whether he gets the starts or not, if you've got, you know, Pedro Porro, who's flagged, if you're worried about Nkunku because of the arrival of Joao Felix and the fact that he went off on 57 minutes, all of those problems, yes, they're problems, but unless they're directly ruled out in the case of, like, Barco, and we'll have to see on Porro, then it's probably worth just taking that extra bit of breathing space, particularly if your bench is strong enough to cover it, like it sounds like yours is. Kelly. 

Kelly Somers [00:14:17]
Yeah, that said, I did mean to get rid of Konsa before his price dropped the other day. But I don't feel like I can blame my nine month old daughter anymore. But I did. 

Julien Laurens [00:14:25]
You can. 

Kelly Somers [00:14:26]
I am gonna blame her for this one because I fell asleep early with her and couldn't decide what to do. I was gonna do Konsa for Robinson. Or was I? Wasn't I? Or maybe I should use the million to go up to Porro. I know Porro's flagged. I, uh, think about it when I'm laying in bed with her, huh? Next thing, and I've woken up at seven in the morning and his price has dropped. So I'm sure there's lots of people listening to this podcast that have been there. A price drop has maybe caught you out. Something to bear in mind this season, if you can see, particularly early on, if you can see that a player is being heavily transferred out or even in, their price might rise or fall. So just bear that in mind to make sure you can still afford them when you do go on to make that transfer. I've also got to shout out someone that I know, someone I worked with this summer, um, when I was away with England, sent me their FPL team, and she said, I'm going to work really hard this year. I'm going to try and really stick to it. She sent me a team and I was, oh, that's a really nice team. You've done really well to get kind of some big players in there. And she'd got Jota in there and I was like, oh, great. Yeah, I think Jota's a great option. Turns out there's a player called Jota Silva. 

Julien Laurens [00:15:22]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:23]
And so when she saw Jota return a forest. Yep. I don't know how she didn't notice. So she sent me after the game weeks and I didn't get any points from Jota because it was Jota Silva. And I was like, so when she'd sent me the screen grab, I'd just seen the red shirt and not zoomed in. I'm not gonna name her, but the only way's up from here because, of. 

Sam Bonfield [00:15:40]
Course, Jota's under Diogo, isn't he? In the game? Yes. 

Julien Laurens [00:15:43]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:44]
Yes. Uh, anyway, that was probably my favorite. It made me feel so much better when I was a little bit disappointed about my game week. So I'm not going to name her, but, yeah, better luck next time. Okay, on to price changes, then. I mentioned them then. At this stage of the season, it is so important, particularly if you have no money in the bank. Sam, just explain why it is so important and how it can completely disrupt any plans you have for your team. 

Sam Bonfield [00:16:08]
Yeah. So players, as you seen this week, Kelly, can rise and fall. Now, this season has been a bit of an anomaly really because there hasn't been very many price changes so far. Usually after the Friday night first match we've seen multiple price changes by Saturday morning and you're kind of sitting there going, oh goodness. But if you lose point one in a player, it can make your life really difficult because suddenly getting from one player to the next, unless you've kept some money in the bank, is almost impossible. You have to go down a price point rather than being able to just go across from a, uh, 4.5 to a another 4.5 because your players now only worth 4.4. So that makes it difficult. But you also have to watch it the other way as well. Because if you want to sell a player that's not dropping in price but the player you want to buy is going to rise in price again, you can find yourself 0.1 short. And that point one is the most frustrating thing as an FBI manager because you can't get the player that you really want to have and then you're making compromises. So that's why in preseason we were talking quite a lot about leaving, you know, somewhere around the 0.5 or a million in your case curls in the bank because it allows you that flexibility to not have to panic. And the fact that Quons has dropped, you don't need to panic on it because you do have that extra budget in the, in the bank. 

Kelly Somers [00:17:22]
Yeah. A million though in the bank for me is a bit wild, isn't it? Really? Never seen before. 

Julien Laurens [00:17:27]
Never seen before. 

Kelly Somers [00:17:28]
No, Jules, I actually did it because you mentioned Rogers and I brought Rogers into my team. I basically downgraded Anthony Gordon to be able to upgrade my defense to have Saliba and guardiol. And then I was like, you know what, I haven't gotten Gordon now. I didn't love, I can't remember who I'd put in a 6.5 but then I was like, I'm happy with Saka Jota, the right Jotter Ezze, uh, and then Smith Rowe. And I was like, and if I have Rogers as well, I know that I've got two cheaper, ah, midfielders in there, but they're two cheaper midfielders in Smith Roe and Rogers that I think could do well. And I'll see how those two do over the opening weeks. And that million just means I can upgrade them if I want to. Or some of my budget defenders, the likes of Konsa, Barso, Mosquera. I can upgrade those if I want to. So it was madness, but it was madness with a bit of a plan. Sam's vaguely nodding at me, which makes me feel that it's not the most crazy thing I've ever done. 

Sam Bonfield [00:18:19]
No, it's right. 

Julien Laurens [00:18:20]
Yeah, it's good. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:21]
I'm surprised I managed to do it, to be honest. Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:18:22]
Yeah, me too. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:23]
It was literally just before the deadline. It won't surprise you. And I was like, oh, it's making me feel sick having a million in the bank. But I think this is quite smart, just for once. 

Julien Laurens [00:18:29]
It seemed that you had a plan, so it's good because as you know, it's all about, uh, talent, planning and vision, obviously. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:35]
So, yeah. Jules, for those of you that aren't watching on YouTube, Jules has just put his lovely notebook that, uh, we gifted him when he won our league last year. 

Julien Laurens [00:18:43]
When I did what he's held when I did what? 

Kelly Somers [00:18:45]
When? Ah, you won the league last, uh, year. You're not winning it at the moment. 

Julien Laurens [00:18:47]
No, no, I just forgot I won last year. Oh, yeah, he forgot, you know, 4000 in the world. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:51]
You've got it tattooed on your right arm, haven't you? 

Julien Laurens [00:18:53]
It's coming because I can't have it in the summer because then I can't tan if I've got the tattoo too early. So it comes later. 

Kelly Somers [00:19:00]
Right back to the price changes then, rather than Jules bodily tattoos or whichever weird direction. So the price changes this week. Actually, having said all that about price changes, it's been quite a quiet week in terms of price changes. By Monday morning, no players had risen or fallen in price. In fact, only one player had been transferred in by over 100,000 managers, which is very low. Sam, um, do we quickly, do we think that's just because managers are maybe listening to us, taking our advice, just waiting to feel things out a little bit? 

Sam Bonfield [00:19:28]
Yeah, I think there's a few potential things. I think it could be that people were having more patience this year generally. Uh, actually, people's teams did quite well in game week one. The average was high. So it might be that people are feeling quite positive about their teams. It's possible that people are thinking about the five transfers and the fact that they don't have to make them and that's why they're doing it. Um, maybe therefore people are planning rather than impulse reacting. Maybe people are listening to us more, which is, you know, would be nice if that's the reason. Ah, maybe also people are starting to realize the importance of press conferences at the back end of the week. And maybe once we hear from the managers, we will then see people get transferred out. Like Porro, I would expect if he gets ruled out by poster Cogli, that he would get sold quite heavily because at five and a half you're not likely to keep him because of the matches post Everton. But uh, yeah, I think there's a few reasons it could be. I'm, um, kind of intrigued to see what happens at the back end of the week and whether we see more price rises and price falls than we have so far. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:24]
Yes, there's no rises, um, at the time of recording on Thursday morning, so we'll have to wait and see. Obviously rises happen overnight UK time. In terms of the players that have fallen, though, not too many surprises here, I don't think. Ivan, Tony, after he missed out on the Brentford squad with lots of speculation around him. Darwin, Nunes, Jules, bit of heartbreak for you when you saw Nunes not start, and now his price has fallen. 

Julien Laurens [00:20:47]
Yeah, uh, it's not so much Darwin time at the moment for him. Which is. Which is it might change. 

Sam Bonfield [00:20:52]
It'll be cheaper when you want to get him later though, Jules. 

Julien Laurens [00:20:54]
Yeah, exactly. When he starts banging the gold, you know. But yeah, it's just, it doesn't look good though, because Jota looked so good in Liverpool attack, especially in the second half. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:02]
Good for us though. Cause we've got him. 

Julien Laurens [00:21:03]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Not your friend so much, but for us. Yeah, it's good. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:07]
Yeah, yeah. You've got the right Jota. 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:09]
It's all right. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:10]
And Konsa, 4.4 million he is now. Ah, Rodri at Man city, um, and Jaden Sancho, his price also for. Oh, and Cody Gakpo and Gabrielle, Jesus, are some of the latergest fallers as well. If we take a look at the transfer combinations on the big assets, no surprise, really. See, Havertz is being transferred in, a lot of people already losing patience with Ollie Watkins. Jules, um, Watkins has been transferred out a lot for Havertz and Harland. I think I understand both of them. It feels quite early to do that now. 

Julien Laurens [00:21:41]
I think it is really early, like we said. I mean, especially Ollie Watkins, you know, if you, if you picked somebody a bit random, let's say. But Ollie Watkins, after what happened last season and how good he was for Aston Villa, uh, in terms of goals and even assists, as we kept repeating last season, this surely deserves a bit more of a chance and a bit more time. I mean, Havertz was fantastic in that first game against wolves with the goal and an assist. That's not really an assist, but it was just a pass that, uh, became an assist because of Saka's brilliance. But he counts in the game. If you look at Arsenal's fixture list, though, and like Sam was saying, a little bit the same for Spurs, they will have city to play and Spurs to play very soon now. So bringing Havertz I can understand for Watkins, I find that a little bit surprising, really. I, uh, would not if I, if I had gone with Watkins first. It's because you believe that over the first four or five games, like we said, he can bring you something. It's not because he blanked against West Ham away from home in a tough first game that suddenly Watkins is a bad player. So I always struggle a little bit to see a big name like Watkins being sold quite heavily, really, and transfer out quite heavily for someone like Hawes, who has very difficult games coming over. 

Kelly Somers [00:22:55]
Can perhaps understand it a little bit more if maybe you weren't too sure about going without Haaland and then you see him score early on against Chelsea and then you check his fixtures and you realise you've made a massive mistake. M I can understand that one. 

Sam Bonfield [00:23:06]
Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:23:06]
That one is more understandable on the board. Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:23:07]
Yeah. I can also understand looking at the transfer combination, Sam. M over 30,000 people have done both of these transfers. Cole Palmer to Mo Salah or Bukayo saka. Again, though, Chelsea didn't look too bad. There's a bit of, uh, remember who they were playing against? They were playing against Manchester City. But it maybe goes back to the fact that Cole Palmer is very expensive, is very high priced, and if you're going without Mo Salah and Bukayo Saka, who are very high owned and they're going to keep returning, you could end up falling behind early on. Do you understand those transfer combinations? 

Sam Bonfield [00:23:38]
Yeah, absolutely. I think Cole Palmer is, if you watch the game as well, I agree with you. I thought Chelsea actually were quite good in that game, but he was very wide and if you're watching Palmer as an FPL owner of him, I can see why people would be frustrated about that because he wasn't as involved in the play as we would have wanted and as we would have seen last season. I mean, last season he had free reign to literally do whatever he wanted and be wherever he wanted. This season, particularly in game week one, not so much. It was a bit more of a that's your place, that's where you'll be and that's where he was. And if that continues to be his place, then I would have doubts about having him. But equally, the Chelsea fixtures are actually really nice. They've got a really nice block of fixtures coming up. They had a very difficult home game to start the season. I mean, pretty much the only fixture they could have had that would have been harder than that was if they had to go Manchester City. Um, it was a difficult start to the season. I actually thought they played quite well. But yeah, I can understand it for the two players that people are going to because also if you go from Palmer to Saka, you're saving a little bit of money as well. And that little bit of money might be able to help you with your Konsa issue if you didn't leave money in the bank. Obviously if you're going up to Salah, then you've got to find some money. So also, maybe you're therefore selling Palmer for a hit to get Salah. And that also feels a little bit reactionary. It feels like you're not having the patience with Palmer because you have picked him to start the season for a reason. Knowing you have Man City at the beginning and knowing that he missed all of preseason pretty much with being out with England, uh, at ah, the euros. So I think if you've got Palmer, I'd be a little bit more patient. But I do understand it if you want to get Salah in because his fixtures are really lovely too. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:17]
Should we talk about Mo Salah a little bit? Because we all opted to go without the egyptian king because we couldn't fit him in. They've got a lovely run of fixtures. As Jules, you said Jota, uh, did look good when he played and we've all got him. But how nervy are you not to have Salah? 

Julien Laurens [00:25:33]
It's always, there's always that feeling, isn't it, when you watch him, especially when you take in consideration his own FpL heritage to start with and then how good he still is. I mean, I felt Jota could easily have had a hat trick in that game and outpointed is that word out pointed Mosala easily and in the end just didn't work out because Jota, and like what he usually does was a bit wasteful in front of Golda Heder, especially before he scored his goal. I have to say I was surprised how good mos Salah was in the second half, uh, and how good Liverpool overall changed everything at halftime pretty much to be that good. I didn't expect Ipswich to be able to compete for the whole 90 minutes physically, especially like they did in the first 45 minutes. But still, I thought Salah was outstanding, really. And that made me think, wow, okay, I can't. I try to bring him in and have a decent team around. As we explained last week, I just didn't like it. I didn't like the team. I didn't like the draft that I could have had. So in the end, I chose not to. But again, if you. It's always the same and we repeat it every time, but it's true. Salah is amazing. But if you replace him with the right people so Jota could be one and then somebody else, even like a solanki or someone like that. If you can make up the points that you would not have by not having Salah, that's fine. If you pick the wrong people, then that's going to hurt you heavily. And like we've said earlier, the people who captain Salah for this game week one obviously are all at the top of the world ranking. Every ranking, every mini league, everything you want because that was the right guy to not just have, but also captain. So, well done to them. But it's not the end of the world if, uh, you don't have him you will find another way of getting other players with big points and big points tally. It's just that. Please, mo Salah, don't do that every weekend. 

Kelly Somers [00:27:20]
Yeah, this is a notice from everyone here at the FPL pod. We're having to go without you, so please don't punish us. Please, please, please. Um. But I do see Diogo Jota as a bit of a gift in a way, Sam, because I feel like at the moment with Manchester City, yes, Phil Foden is going to get better with more game time and maybe we'll be able to look elsewhere with him. But I feel like it's harder to cover Harlan's points at, ah, Manchester City. So we've kind of all had to go find that 15 million pounds for Haaland. Whereas with the way that Diogo Jota is playing and the position that he's playing in that Liverpool team at 7.5 million, as Jules said, it's kind of another way of getting into that Liverpool attack and maybe softening the blow of not having Salah. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:01]
I think the narrative here would have been very, very different if Jota puts that other opportunity away and he ends. 

Kelly Somers [00:28:08]
Up on a brace. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:09]
Because we are looking at this as FPL managers going, well, Jota got eight, but Salah was epic and was the highest scoring player in the game week and all of that stuff. And I, uh, was just listening to what Jules was saying then and thinking, yeah, it's absolutely right. Because I watched that Liverpool game and I was like, I've made a horrible mistake. But the thing I said to Lee at full time was, well, it's all on Arsenal now. Because in not having Salah, I had Saliba and Saka and then Porro. So I was like, if those three go and do what I'm hoping that they do, then the decision not to have Salah was still the correct one because I had Jota as well. And actually, as the game played out, it was the right decision for me not to have Salah. Now, going into this week, I don't feel so confident because obviously Arsenal have a much more difficult fixture. They've got to go away to Aston Villa and Spurs. Well, Porro's a doubt. So I'm kind of like now thinking, oh, the Salah not having him is difficult. But I am looking at Jota and I'm thinking he's 5 million less. And, um, that 5 million shouldn't be. We can't just compare them. I mean, we nearly could, to be honest, if Jota puts that chance away, then we can nearly compare them like for like. But we shouldn't really do that because it's 5 million difference in price point. I think Jota is a gift to us at the moment, the way that he played against Ipswich. Now, I know that you've got Darwin and Gakpo and these guys in the background, but Darwin doesn't even get on the pitch in game week one. He brings on Gakpo instead. I think that front three of Diaz, who nobody's been talking about because he was the only one, didn't do anything. But he was good in that game. The three of them, Diaz, uh, Jota and Salah played so well together that moving forward it does feel like you can have a little bit more fun with your Liverpool pick. Whereas you're right, Kells, at the minute with Man City, it's very hard to look away from Haaland because you don't know who's going to get the starts. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:02]
So we're all happy. It sounds like we all want Salah. Of course we want Salah. Who wouldn't want Salah? You're not playing FPL right if you don't want most Salah, quite frankly. But we're all pretty happy with the way we based our team and the way we set our team up. Using Diogo Jota as our Liverpool cover and going with Haaland over him and looking at those fixtures now, Jules, and particularly starting with this week, if you hadn't gone with Haaland, if you'd gone with the other way and just gone Salah, you'd be pretty nervous, wouldn't you? More nervous than we probably are not having Salah right now. 

Julien Laurens [00:30:31]
Yeah, I think so. I mean, for City to win the way they did at Chelsea with literally, it looked like they were in second gear the whole game. They were just never panicking. They were in full control. Even when Chelsea were good, even when Nico Jackson has that chance, uh, one nil in the second half, all of that city looked. I just. I don't know, they looked so imperious, I thought. And they were not even 50% of what they could do, really. And now they might add Gundogan back to these squads to have just another option which is going to make it more difficult for us. But another option for Pepe and Foden is going to come back to full fitness Kyle Walker. So they're going to get even better and stronger now with just a bit more time. So I fear for Ipswich, it's going to be a great day out. If you're a cheeran, go to Manchester. I mean, I was there yesterday, it was cloudy but it didn't rain. Uh, go have fun. But you're going to get smashed. And if you get smashed then Erling Highland is going to probably have a bit of a feast. So this is the way it is, you know. But yeah, I think the whole game is going to be balanced. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:36]
Please. It's probably the most tricky fixture they'll have this season. But a word for it's going to. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:40]
Be difficult for them. I'm just saying, if they get beaten heavily. That's what I meant, if they get beaten heavily. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:45]
First half against Liverpool in particular, I thought m I think they can cause a few teams a few problems this year. Do you not agree, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:51]
Yeah, totally. I actually was really impressed by Ipswich. I'm not sure whether they were playing or on adrenaline in that first what that was. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:59]
I was so jealous of anyone that was there. It looked incredible. 

Sam Bonfield [00:32:01]
Didn't I know, right. It was. It was a fantastic first half of football. They were. Ipswich were really impressive. I was like, oh, hello. There are a few options in this Ipswich team. 

Kelly Somers [00:32:11]
You didn't go with Leaf Davis in the end, did you? 

Sam Bonfield [00:32:13]
No. I didn't. And actually looking back on it, so disappointing. I was. I know I should have done, but. 

Kelly Somers [00:32:18]
More fun if you had. 

Sam Bonfield [00:32:19]
I know, but maybe I might because. 

Kelly Somers [00:32:21]
Remember, maybe I will now. I haven't got any defenders. 

Sam Bonfield [00:32:23]
Yeah, but my original plan, no, my original plan was to downgrade Porro at some stage anyway to a 4.5. And I thought by the time I want to do that after game week two then Leif Davis fixtures are really nice but uh, at uh, points during preseason I had Hutchinson in my team as well as a cheap option and I was quite impressed by him as well. I think there are a number of options at Ipswich and we will all be like, oh my goodness, it's the hardest fixture they're going to have this year in game week two and it absolutely is. So I wouldn't recommend you do it now, but from game week three onwards, they've got a really nice block of fixtures where you could see them getting some FPL points and maybe they're, they're not bad picks from that moment on, but I can't see them getting much away. At Manchester City. 

Julien Laurens [00:33:04]
I didn't say anything wrong, did I? 

Kelly Somers [00:33:07]
Nothing wrong. But I was just offering some balance because it's a pretty tricky start to the season for them. Having Liverpool and then Manchester. 

Julien Laurens [00:33:13]
Yeah, for sure. 

Sam Bonfield [00:33:14]
Pretty much. 

Kelly Somers [00:33:15]
And I did think that they, I did think that they were really impressive at times and they're a team. As Sam said, in a few game weeks I'm sure we'll be talking about a little bit more. Okay, I've digressed a lot. And producer Jesse, who I'm giving a bit of fame to quite a lot on the podcast now, hasn't texted me yet. But at some point we'll be like, this wasn't in the plan. Where are you going with this? Keep on. Keep on target where we're going. Talking of targets, top targets for game week two. Interestingly, last season, 28% of the overall managers signed up to FPL between game week one and two. So if you have got a friend or a family member or someone who's toying with starting playing this season and they say, oh, I've already missed a game week and what, it's not too late. It's never too late. But particularly at this stage of the season, you're only going to be a few points behind. It'll only take a few game weeks or one good captaincy pick to catch up. So do kind of encourage people to join in. Um, top targets though, Jules, who would you be looking at this week if you were going to go against Starfights and maybe make an early transfer? 

Julien Laurens [00:34:14]
Uh, it's a tricky one, I think again after game week one because you don't have this trend. We said Welbeck did well. You had other really good performers, but they might blank in game week two. Uh, it's just hard after just one game, I guess if something didn't work in your team. So you've got, like you said, either somebody's flagged or injured or suspended or has left the Premier League, has left the club, something like that. Then you need to change depending on if he's a defender, midfielder or forward. I think as we've been saying, a pick like Danny Welbeck for example, up front. If you're looking for that kind of budget player, it's really good. Now that we know. For example, if you looking for Liverpool defender and you can't afford Andy Robertson or Trent Alexander Arnold or even Virgil van Dijk, maybe Konate would be a good pick. Because as we saw he steadied the ship in the second half, uh, Ipswich and he will start in game week two. So it's just opportunities like that I think make uh, it worth it for people. If really you want to change your squad, I would again advise not to make too many changes and not to go for too many different things for game week two. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:21]
Yeah. 

Sam Bonfield [00:35:21]
Okay. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:22]
So we spent this whole podcast saying don't be too hasty with your transfers. Probably don't make one this week. And then I've asked you which transfer you would make. Sam, I'll make this a more pointed question. It seems like most people, if they are going to make a transfer, it's because of those defensive issues that I spoke about. If you are looking for a cheap defender to take the place of some of the players that we've mentioned, your Barco, your cons or any of those, maybe even Porro, if he is ruled out, who would you suggest they look at? 

Sam Bonfield [00:35:46]
I mean, I think there's two ways of looking at this. You either look at it by saying who's got the best fixture this week? And if you're doing that, then you're looking at ah, a cheap asset from Spurs or Fulham, maybe even Southampton. So you've got Van de Ven, you've got um, Robinson at Fulham. You've got maybe even Harwood Bellis at Southampton who's just four. So if you're looking for a Barco replacement, you could go like for like in terms of that particular. But if you're building a team from scratch and if you are, you know, coming into it ahead of game week two, and that's going to be your first week, then I think you have to look at it slightly differently and you have to look slightly more long term. If you're doing that, then the teams that you're going to target are going to be different. Potentially you'd still got Fulham in there. So Robinson is looking like a fantastic cheap option. But, um, you've also got other players from teams like Southampton who remain a nice pick moving forward in terms of the fixtures anyway. But you also get club like Crystal palace and Chelsea who come up with nice fixtures once we get, you know, a couple more weeks down the line. So looking at teams like them and Aston Villa, who have got one of the most difficult games coming up in game week two, but after that, really good fixtures, they're the kind of teams that I'd be looking at. But for me right now, the standout 4.5 is Anthony, um, Robinson at Fulham. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:59]
Yeah, I totally agree. That was the transfer I wish I'd done and I wish I had, but inadvertently I'm taking the advice of this podcast, not through my actual own choice. Okay, time for differential of the week. Sam, come on. Then you keep a tally of this. You've got your head in your hands. Didn't start well, did it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:16]
Well, I blame you for this, Kels, because, uh. Yeah, because last week you went all strict and were like, no, you can't do this. And you can't do this. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:23]
You have to start a new school term. Strict. That's what I'm doing. I'm doing hand actions that demonstrate that I am cracking the whip this season. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:30]
To be fair, when I was back in my teaching days, that was always my policy. Start strict and then become a. Oh. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:34]
Yeah, by game we term go, whatever. I'll be like, do whatever you want. Want. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:39]
Yeah, exactly. Um, yeah, so you allow. We had two random differentials of each last week. So Jules ended up with Jota. What do you mean random how that happened? Well, because she randomly said we had to have two because we weren't supposed to have Jota. But anyway, we won't go back there. So you had Jota and Minta. Jota obviously got eight. Minta, uh, got four before going off. So eyes on him as well going into this week. And my two, I had Bowen and Smith Roe. Both of them, no great picks. Not great. Well, I still think Smith Roe might be a great pick in FPL moving forward, but wasn't a great differential. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:15]
It was a bold pick for man united away on the opening day. 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:17]
It was, yeah. I mean, he did go off before the clean sheet went. So at least he got three, uh, rather than two, but yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:23]
Are we counting that as a return? Probably. 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:25]
No, we're not counting that as a return. 

Julien Laurens [00:38:26]
So how many points did you get? 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:28]
Uh, so I got 5 and 2. So you win this week. Uh, but you know, I'm leading in the mini league so we'll just do a role reversal for this time. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:36]
Can we still get. Jules just puffed his chest up, rubbed his chest in and it looks even worse because he's got like a t shirt with some weird gold thing on it. It was like rubbing the gold bit as if to if it was like a trophy or something weird. So Jules has the upper hand there. Sam, um, is just about leading. 

Julien Laurens [00:38:51]
Just very clever picks from Jules. That's what, that's what I meant. 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:54]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:54]
Go on then. Which clever pick have you got for us this week? Winner can go first. 

Julien Laurens [00:38:57]
Okay, so this week I, uh, picked Jamie Vardy, uh, obviously who's having a party, a massive party. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:04]
Have you gone for him? Because you look fuming that he's picked it up. 

Sam Bonfield [00:39:06]
No, I haven't. I just thought it was random because Jamie Vardy. Did you see there was a clip that the Premier League put out of Jamie Vardy and they asked him the question that they asked all Premier League players, why should people go for you in FPL? And he went, don't waste your money. And I loved it so much it made me laugh. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:22]
Did you enjoy his message to the Spurs fans as he came? 

Sam Bonfield [00:39:25]
No, I did not enjoy him. His message to the Spurs fans and it literally was fueled by just Red Bull as he was drinking it in the tunnel coming out for the second half. I was not happy with Jamie Vardy. 

Julien Laurens [00:39:34]
Jamie Vardy who really scored one, uh, a good head by obviously the, uh, Spurs marking as we know in a Spurs don't, uh, know how to mark people. But then could have scored a second one. To be fair to him, I expected him to score that one. Even on his left foot he looked good. He's 37 years old, play high intensity football for 90 minutes every single game of the season. So at some point he will get a race, he will come off early like we saw in the game on Monday night, but aware Fulham where you would expect Fulham to have a lot of the ball unless they can play on the counter attack. I think this is perfect for Vardy. 5.5 million owned by 3.1% of the managers. Eight points returned in that first game against burrs. Could have been more, should have been more. So yeah. Jamie, party to have another Jimmy party. Jamie Vardy to have another party, uh, at the weekend again. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:24]
Jamie, party for Jules. What about you, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:28]
Um, so I actually had two. One of them is completely out there so I might just give a shout out. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:32]
Just pick one that might bring you some points. Just whoever. 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:35]
Okay. So um, this is an absolute heart over head pick because, you know if in doubt, go back to Spurs. Um, and so I've gone for James, I've gone for Madison this week and um, so he's only owned by 4.8% of the game. And I spent all of preseason going, don't buy Madison, I don't think he's a great FPL pick. I think there are better picks at Spurs, all of that stuff. However, he actually impressed me against Leicester in that first half. I thought he was really good. Um, Spurs scored four times against game, week two opponents Everton last season. Madison missed the home game through injury but he did get an assist in the away fixture last time around. He tends to base himself closer to the left where son is and as a result of that, ah, I think that will be the side that Spurs identify as Everton's weak point because that's where Ashley Young should be and clearly he is suspended having got his red card in game week one. So I think there's most likely to be more Spurs attacks down that side with Madison and son. Um, he also has the set piece threat. Spurs had 13 corners on Monday night. He took twelve of them. Porro didn't take any, which was interesting to me. Um, he only didn't take the 13th one because he wasn't on the pitch when we got that one. The same with free kicks. He took three of the four that we had and again, I only didn't take the last one because he wasn't on the pitch at that point. Um, and actually when you look across the Spurs team, only sun had more touches in the final third against Leicester on Monday than Maddison did. So it was very advanced on set pieces. It's a nice home fixture against an Everton defence that looked weaker. Ah, so I've gone for Madison. 

Julien Laurens [00:42:05]
It's a really good pick after like more seriously now because we joked earlier I was as impressed as Sam was on Monday night by Madison. To be fair, it freaks me out. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:15]
With you to agree. 

Julien Laurens [00:42:16]
No, it's like it doesn't happen very often to the point that I thought about bringing him into my team for game week two and I will wait a bit. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:24]
What's going on here? 

Kelly Somers [00:42:25]
I feel very angry. 

Julien Laurens [00:42:26]
Yeah, no, no, no. Uh, I agree. I thought it was really, really sharp physically too, and outstanding. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:32]
I'm a bit scared that you're going to go on, Sam. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:34]
I was going to say just, just in case he does really well. My backup pick was Flynn Downs from Southampton. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:42]
You've absolutely killed yourself there though because uh, you've used it early. If you want to use Flynn Downs again, Jules is going to go. No, no, no, you can't. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:50]
But I just, I'm just. He's not my pick. I'm just making it out there because it's the fixture that I kind of particularly like. Their first home game of the season. Only, um, three midfielders have more created, more chances. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:01]
Alright, guys, we're not going to be doing two picks a week right now because podcast called differential of the week. Differential. 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:08]
Watch. It's loads of different. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:09]
Yeah, it's just I don't think it's going to get as many listeners as we do. So let's try and stick just to one podcast. Um, you've agreed on that and I'm m pretty sure you're going to agree on this last bit. Erling Haaland captain do we need to have a conversation? Probably not, no. Do we need to have a conversation though, as they did on off the bench about a potential triple captain, Julian Laurent? 

Julien Laurens [00:43:29]
Um, yeah, I think that's a better conversation to have. As we've said in the, in our like preview shows, we know that because of the way the FA cup will happen, uh, this season we will have less double game week for a team like City, for example, who always go very far in the FA cup, which means that there might not be many m maybe not at all. Double game week for City and Haaland to play. And that's usually where we play our uh, triple captain because, you know, somebody like him with two games in the same week that count for the same game week in the game, then it's a lot of points that you can obviously trouble. So if you forget about double game week and just think about single game week, I mean, Ipswich at home for City is a game that you would expect him to score. The only thing I would say is so early in the season that I'm a bit skeptical about the triple captain so early. This is it. Uh, if this game was in game week twelve, I probably would play triple captain on Haaland. On game week two. I'm, um, not sure I will be just brave enough, really, that's all to do it, because it's still so early. I don't think he's fully, fully match fit. I think Ipswich have still a lot of energy and they will fight a lot like they did against Liverpool in that first half. So it might be a mistake and he might score a hat trick and then the triple captain would be wise, would have been wise, but I'm, um, not sure I'm brave enough now if he blanks. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:50]
It's a long old season to regret that decision for, isn't it? That's the way I look at it. Know I like leaving my chips quite late. It's no surprise. I've not even considered it. Sam, have you? 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:59]
Uh, I considered it fleetingly and my decision came down to that. I don't think Manchester City are yet. Manchester City, like, they've got a lot of players still coming back from the summer. And I just think in three, four, five game weeks time that Manchester City team, their performances will be significantly better to what they might be now. And that's saying something, because they played well against Chelsea and they dominated in terms of. They controlled that game really nicely. Um, and I think they'll do the same this time. But I just think further into the season, we'll see a better Manchester City side when you've got the Rodrigues and the fodens and everybody match fit and back in the team and knowing what everybody is doing. Whereas right now I have just a few niggles about Man City, not in terms of them winning, but just in terms of, are they fully up to speed right now? And, um, because of that, that makes me want to leave the chip until I know I've got a team in perfect form and a player in perfect form, because that feels like the best combination for playing that triple captainship. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:00]
Okay, if you don't have Haaland, so we're all going to caption him, we're not going to triple caps in him. If you were one of those brave managers that didn't go with Haaland this season, by the way, over 267,000 managers have currently triple captained him. Sam, is that triple caps in on him? 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:14]
You? That's just the active chips. But I would be very surprised if many of those are going anywhere other than on Harlem. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:23]
It's quite early for that many triple captains to be active, isn't it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:26]
Yeah. It's a big week for triple captains. I think a lot of managers are looking at it potentially with a view that, you know, how often, maybe with the rolling of the transfers thing, people are thinking, well, maybe I won't always have Harlan in my team. Maybe I'll be swapping around the premiums and saving transfers here and there. So now I've got Harlan. He says he's in the best form ever going into the season and he's fully fit and all of that stuff. And it's a really great fixture and it's a home fixture, so I can see why people are doing it. And it is a big number of people, and it will undoubtedly go up as we get closer to the deadline as well. 

Kelly Somers [00:47:00]
Okay, so if you aren't triple captaining Harland, or if you aren't captaining him, and what I was starting to say before was, if you don't have him in your teen, Jules, who would be the best other option? I'm thinking that if you don't have Haaland in your team, you're likely to have Salah. So you should probably captain him. Do you think? 

Julien Laurens [00:47:17]
Yeah, Salah makes sense. One of the Liverpool, um, one of Jota or Salah. I think the most informed, really, if you want to go for an Arsenal player like a soccer or Harvard to wear villa, uh, on the late game on Saturday, that will be brave, really, because again, this is going to be a really tough game. Remember Arsenal lost over there last season, even if they played really well, probably deserve more than that defeat. Newcastle away, Bournemouth again to go back to our Esak pick. That's tricky. So, yeah, I think it makes sense. If you don't have. If you don't want. If you don't have Haaland or you don't want Holland as captain to go with one of the Liverpool boys. 

Kelly Somers [00:47:56]
Do you agree, Sam? And I'm wondering if maybe if you don't have Haaland, a lot of people might have Foden or might be bringing Foden in now that he's kind of back, could he be another option against Ipswich? 

Sam Bonfield [00:48:06]
Yeah, I think Foden will get the start against Ipswich in game week two. I would expect that he would. So if you don't have Haaland but you have Foden, you could absolutely go there. I agree with Jules on the jota and the Sala picks. I also think that the, the Spurs attack is probably a decent differential punt for the captaincy against Everton. I also think that Isak could still be a good captaincy punt in game week two, though, because in reality, the reason that he doesn't get more points. Probably falls at, uh, Fabian Charles feet a little bit for that red card because the game fundamentally changed and like Southampton, conceded the fewest chances in game week one, which is madness when you think about how we rule out. Oh, it could be an absolute hatfall for Newcastle. Games change on sendings off and it definitely changed the way that Newcastle attacked. Whereas going into game week two, I would expect that they wouldn't be kind of so chained up, I guess, in terms of the attack. So, yeah, I think he could still be an option. But Liverpool or another Manchester City attacker, if it's fode and they feel like the obvious ones. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:10]
Yeah, they do indeed. Okay, so I think we're all set. No transfers across the pod. Is that correct? 

Julien Laurens [00:49:15]
Yeah, enough for me. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:15]
We are all taking our own advice and being patient. And we're all captioning, not triple captaining, harland. We're quite original this week, aren't we? Um, okay, so that's where we will leave it. Thanks as always, guys. Also, I should say a quick thank you. I'm not. If you are watching YouTube, you'll notice I'm not in my usual place. I'm actually at, ah, a premier League football club. I'm at. Let's get this out. 

Julien Laurens [00:49:35]
Stella, are you working now? 

Kelly Somers [00:49:37]
Uh, are you the tea lady? 

Julien Laurens [00:49:39]
Tea lady Aborman. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:41]
I'm hosting an event here later today, so a big thank you to them for lending me the space to do the podcast this morning. I just feel a bit bad now that we haven't spoken about any of their FPL players, but I'm sure we will at some point during the season. Sam, do you want me to pass on the thanks for them giving you. 

Sam Bonfield [00:49:56]
Their forward, give them a big hug and say thank you very much for me. 

Julien Laurens [00:49:59]
It was expensive though. 

Kelly Somers [00:50:00]
I will do potentially though, some exciting signings happening here at Bournemouth. We didn't get time to speak about them this week, but I get the feeling we will be talking about them in the coming weeks. Uh, but that's why we will leave it a reminder. Your deadline is 11:00 a.m. on Saturday. That's 90 minutes ahead of Brighton versus Manchester United. The Saturday morning panic is back, especially if your name is Kelly Summers. Um, a reminder off the bench is also back with you throughout this season. It was with us on Monday and this it will be Johnny and Praz talking you through all the game. Week two talking points. I also feel quite bad because obviously I present the fantasy show, the tv show, and I haven't mentioned once that that's been back. We've already done two shows of that and we will be back on Friday. And I'm told there's going to be a familiar face alongside me on the sofa. Sam, it's me already your second appearance of the season as well. So if you haven't had enough of Sam and Kelly, make sure you tune in, um, in the UK, that will be on Sky Sports and TNT. It will also be on the Premier League website and app. And if you're listening around the world, check out the listings. I don't know exactly where it goes out in every country, but it does go out somewhere. So, uh, please do join us for that. And myself, Sam and Jules will all be back together as always, next Thursday in your podcast feed. We do love it if you rate and, um, review. And also don't forget to join us in that FPL pod mini league. The very best of luck. And remember, Captain Harland, or you might regret it. 

Sam Bonfield [00:51:13]
Bye.
