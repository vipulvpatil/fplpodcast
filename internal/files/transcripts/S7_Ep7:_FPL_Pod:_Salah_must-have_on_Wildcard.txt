Kelly Somers [00:00:01]
Three weeks in and we're already on an international break. We're taking stock by talking. Wild cards is big at the back back. And we're all desperate for Trenton Salah after Liverpool's strong start. Hello and welcome back to the FPL pod. You know the drill by now. It's an international break, but that doesn't mean that we are going anywhere. Sam Bondfield, Julian Laurent alongside me. Sam, how are we already at the first international break? 

Sam Bonfield [00:00:29]
I don't know. It feels really quick, doesn't it? Last year it was after game week five, I think. So to be off to game week three. It feels really early this year, but it's nice to stop and have a breath and reflect, I guess. 

Kelly Somers [00:00:40]
Yeah, let's reflect a bit. Jules. Morning. Um, how are you feeling about your team? 

Julien Laurens [00:00:44]
Well, it was not a great week. 66 point. I mean, it's not bad, 66, just slightly above average. But there's obviously players in the team m and that's the good thing, I guess, about this international break is that you can look at your players and people that you fancied at the start of the season. And now after three games, you have a bit more of a feeling of who's doing well, what team are doing well, what's working, what's not working for you, but also for the real players and the real managers in real life, not just in the game. So it's a good time for some. It might be a bit early to change everything and play wild cards. Some might want to wait. They follow the next international break next month, which will arrive. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:18]
That's like you. That's what you do, isn't it? 

Julien Laurens [00:01:20]
Yeah. Usually I like it. Um, but others might feel like right now is the time to change 5678 players. Whatever you want in your squad. So it's a good time because I think you have a bit of a trend now of what's been working. You see the teams that do well, the ones that, uh, maybe are on the way up, the ones on the way down. Even after three games, you got more of a feeling really than a couple of weeks ago. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:42]
How are you feeling about your team, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:01:44]
I still really liked my team. There's a couple of players in there that I would happily swap for somebody else. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:50]
Name the same. 

Sam Bonfield [00:01:52]
I feel a bit bad. Um, I'd really like a new goalkeeper. Dean Henderson. 

Julien Laurens [00:01:56]
That's nothing new. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:57]
I don't think you're the only one. Yeah. In fact, sam, why did I go with the same goalkeeper as you at the start of the season? 

Sam Bonfield [00:02:01]
No one knows Kelly. I mean, me and goalkeepers, we have very much a love hate relationship and I love them and they seem to hate me and bringing me any points. So, uh, I would like to change my goalkeeper. I feel like I had the strategy right in preseason when I had Raya for all that time and then saved the money and went instead with Henderson. And I'd really like to fix that. Um, and there are a couple of other positions where I'm kind of looking and going Barco m for example, now that he's gone, I'd like to. 

Kelly Somers [00:02:29]
What a headache that lad is. 

Sam Bonfield [00:02:32]
I'd like to sort that. But the rest of my team I'm looking at and I'm thinking with the exception of salah, uh, who I'd obviously like but don't have the rest of them, I'm still quite happy with. 

Kelly Somers [00:02:41]
Okay, well, we'll come on to our teams in a bit more detail, maybe our plans for them very shortly. You know, I'm going to do this early on because I did it very late in the last podcast. Let's check in with the FPL pod mini league. I meant to do that at the beginning so I'll follow instructions today. A reminder, if you haven't joined our code yet, it's q seven yco zero. And there's actually someone new at the top. Ayanda Langer. Their team Young Bucks um, had a game week score of 98. So close to that 100. They did play their free hit chip meaning they had all three of the week's top scoring players. I'm very jealous of this. In Saleh Haaland and Mbumu Ayanda has now played both their free hit and dribble captain chip in the opening three game weeks of the season. But I'm guessing Ayanda also triple captain Harlan the week before. So that's probably two very, very good uses of chips. James White is in second. His team is Joe Linton enjoyer. Guessing a Newcastle fan there got 97 points for the week but has been chip happy so far. Playing the wild card for game week three and the free hit and bench boost chips in game weeks one and two. That means he now only has triple captain to play. Also a big shout out to Brett Windham in 8th place. The only manager in our top ten to reach the all important 100 club this week. He got 102 points and triple captain Haaland for his second hat trick of this season. It's already getting very interesting at the top. So in terms of our mini league, for once I got the most out of the three of us. I should say four, because Ian's still in our league. We won't mention Ian because. Well, uh, in fact, we have to mention Ian. Why do we have to mention Ian, Jules? 

Julien Laurens [00:04:08]
Because he was terrible this week. 

Kelly Somers [00:04:09]
Because he didn't. Captain Harland. 

Julien Laurens [00:04:11]
Yes, exactly. That's why. 

Kelly Somers [00:04:12]
He tried to be clever, didn't he? 

Julien Laurens [00:04:14]
Yeah, too clever. Ian, you know, Ian, come on. 

Kelly Somers [00:04:17]
Yeah. What you doing won't let you back on this podcast. So you sort of say that. I'm joking. I'm being mean as well. Um, yeah, I got 78 somehow, which was quite useful, to be honest, because it had a bit of a poor start to the season. Sam still leads the way with 69 points, 218 overall. I'm in second place on 207 overall. Jules got 66 for the game week, as he said, and he's on 200. Um, five. Would you say at this point, Jules, you're on course for where you thought you were going to be? Are you happy with how the start's gone? 

Julien Laurens [00:04:46]
I mean, you always want more points, obviously. But to be fair, as we always say, this is a long season. It's a marathon. There's plenty more points to get, more players to find. The only thing I would say right now is because. Which is normal at the start of any seasons, a lot of the managers have similar players, which is true. You go for the same names, and it's important to find differentials already, and that's what set you up. Of course, you can find the right captain. And like we've mentioned, Ian and Haaland, if you miss this one out, then it's hurting you massively. But even outside that, if you, for example, if you went with Salah and Haaland, if you were either brave enough or if you were happy with your team with those two, which I wasn't, that's why I didn't keep that draft in, which maybe I should have, but on the moment, I was just not happy with the players around them. Then obviously, Salah and Haaland have, uh, 41 points each already in the game. That's 82 points just for the two of them. So it's pretty incredible when you think about it, you know? And that's without captaincy. So this is. This is good. If you've started well with those players, if you had found differentials already, even better. So if you had Welbeck from the beginning or very, very soon after game week one, somebody like that, it's massive. If you had Trent or the Liverpool defenders, because they're the only teams who haven't conceded yet, obviously. That's great. So it's all of that. So, um, I'm, um, where I am now. I don't think you can really have any regrets after three game weeks unless you play the chip and you played it badly. But outside of that, I don't think I could have any regrets and I don't think really anybody should because it's only three games. You've tried things that you thought was good, players that you like, players that you saw in, um, preseason, players that you saw game week one, game week two. And like we said earlier, now it's the right time, um, if you want to make adjustment or changes, food changes, little changes, doesn't matter so much. But it's hard to have regrets after three game weeks, really, unless you've done something silly. 

Kelly Somers [00:06:41]
Come on. Surely we all regret having Barco from Brighton. 

Julien Laurens [00:06:45]
Yeah, but he's on your bench, like. Yeah, I see what you mean. Of course you do. But he's on your bench and I, uh, think he could have stayed there. I'm not even sure, even if he had been a Brighton player, how much we would have played him anyway, considering their schedule. So, yeah, you're right. This is one of the little things maybe you would have done differently. But on the bigger picture, after three games, I think it's hard to have really big, big regrets. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:07]
I think my big regret is probably not going bold and doing the Haaland and Salah. Wildcard. 

Julien Laurens [00:07:12]
Yeah, me too. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:13]
Not wildcard, sorry. The draft at the beginning of the season. Because those managers that have got Haaland and Salah to this point, Sam, um, they've been rewarded, haven't they, for stripping the rest of their team? Essentially they have. 

Sam Bonfield [00:07:24]
But also, I think if you had Luis Diaz instead of Salah, we went. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:28]
The wrong way, maybe, didn't we? 

Sam Bonfield [00:07:30]
Yeah, it didn't feel that way in game week one, did it? Like game week one? We were all like, okay, well, Jota feels like he's going to be okay. Game meets two and three. It's very much been Luis Diaz that's been the one that's been covering Salah, uh, from a Liverpool perspective. And I think that was what was difficult. So, uh, this week I was on for a huge green arrow, and I was so happy with it on Saturday night. And then Sunday rolled round, spurs lost, but Isak scored. So I was like, well, my FPL team is at least doing well. My actual team's in the mud, but there you are. And then the Liverpool game kicked off and only having Jota. The impact on my rank was absolutely huge because obviously the clean sheet stuck for Trent and Robertson and Alison. There was goals for Salah and there were goals for Diaz. And all of that stuff was just like, oh, uh, this is having a knock on impact and it has. That's probably for me, the one thing I need to think about is Liverpool. I wasn't exactly sure what we'd see from Liverpool under slot and therefore I've played it a little bit safer with my investment there at the beginning of the season. Now, I think that's the area of my team that I need to fix the most and make sure that I'm a bit more heavily invested in Liverpool moving forward. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:37]
Yeah, I think there'll be a few managers thinking that and as a result, a lot of managers will probably be tempted into a wild card. As Jules mentioned, a really popular time of the season to play as it stands. So we're recording this week on Wednesday morning, first thing, there's over 480,000 wild cards active. There's already a few people that have gone big with their triple captain. I bet a lot of these are on Haaland just because he's got Brentford at home and they're thinking, come on. He keeps getting these hat tricks and there's over 110,000 of those active, over 67,000 hits and over 42,000 bench boosts. So yeah, it does feel like international breaks are a popular time for wild cards in particular. And Sam, can you understand people playing them even as early as three game weeks in? I'm also going to buy the way at this point. Shout out Glenn Murray, who told me he actually played his wild card last week. He had an amazing week. He got about 90 points. But I was on the train back from Manchester with him on Saturday and he said, I've had a really great week, but I've got to admit I played my wild card already and I was like, I don't hate that. I do think there's merit and if your team isn't performing, sort it out. Do you agree, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:09:39]
Yeah, it's interesting because obviously Lee played his last week and it went well for the most part. I think there's pros and cons to doing it both ways. Obviously there's pros to going early, like we spoke about last week, in that you can get on people quickly as the fixture runs are about to happen. But there's also pros of leaving it later, particularly now that we can roll transfers if you are relatively happy with your team and you don't have any major issues, then you could do it that way. I think for me, the international breakaway always feels like a nice time to wild card. It gives you two weeks of thinking time and you're not feeling quite so rushed into making decisions like there's nothing worse than trying to make them. I think like you did last year, Kel, it was between a weekend game weekend and a midweek game week. 

Kelly Somers [00:10:22]
Yeah, I did. 

Sam Bonfield [00:10:22]
Having that short amount of time, there's not enough time to think about it. Whereas over an international break, obviously, you get the full two weeks, it means you can deal with injuries that come pre the international break, but also you can watch for Foreman injuries and late returns stuff over the international break. And I think it also means that you can work on your team value. And for me, that's something that's really important at this point in the season. You're trying, wherever you can at this point to catch the price rises before they happen and to get off players before they take a price drop, because that will improve your team value. And whilst at the moment, that's probably not making much difference of 0.10.2 here or there, by the time we get to Christmas, January, when you're looking at your second wildcard, if you've successfully got on the players that have taken price rises, then we could be in a position where by January, your team budget is like 1.11.21 .3 million. And that extra 3 million goes a long way in bringing you in all of the kind of key players. So there's definitely merit in going early with the wild card and playing the game of price changes to make sure that your team has the best value possible. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:27]
Okay, just checking. None of us are wild card in this week, are we? 

Julien Laurens [00:11:31]
Not yet, no, I don't think so. So, Sam, if you have, for example, you've, uh, rolled down your transfer, so you've got five free transfers. By the time you play your wild card, you keep them. It doesn't cancel them like you used to, right? 

Sam Bonfield [00:11:43]
That's right. Yeah. So when you come back out of your wild card, any transfers that you had will still be sitting there waiting. 

Julien Laurens [00:11:48]
For you to use, because there's also. So let's say you don't want to play your wild card now because ideally you wanted to play, you want to play next international break, which, by the way, will be a month after the end of this one. Pretty much. I think there's four or five game weeks between the two. So that goes really quickly. So you can easily play your world card now and then by the time the next international break comes, you've got your five three transfer to do, which, as we've been saying from the beginning with this new rule, it's almost half of a, kind of half of a wild card if you want, because you can change five of your eleven starters, for example, pretty much if you have the money and if things fall in the right places. So this is something that you can easily do. Play your wild card now, and even if that wild card, uh, works for four game weeks, then you still have plenty, and you've rolled on your transfers, you still have plenty of stuff that you can do by the next international break. So I find this new, like, roll on five free transfers that you even keep when you play, like a wild card, for example. Super useful for that. So if you're in between, you're not sure what to do, you can easily do that wild card now and then have this mini wild card in four game weeks or five game weeks, depending how many free transfers you have right now. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:56]
I thought I was going to be really clever, though, and be able to hold my transfers and do these mini wild cards, but it's actually really hard to hold on to the transfers. Do you not find Jules? 

Julien Laurens [00:13:05]
I don't know. I guess it will depend on every manager. Because if you're happy with your team and you just feel, let's say, for example, like a Jotin who hasn't really fired, as much as we've been saying with Diaz, ah, or, uh, Salab, but you feel it's just a question of time until he also scores, because it's inevitable. Jota is not going to finish the season on two goals. He's too good for that. And Liverpool are far too good for that, too. So it depends how you feel about the players that you have. If you've got somebody long term injury, or, uh, like a barcode that you want to change, or if you're not sure about Watkins or Solanke, for example, up front. But we said about Isak, didn't we? Let's give him a bit more time, because again, there was no way Isak would not score at some point, especially playing spurs at the weekend. We were right to keep him, but, so if you're happy with your team, I think it's easier, obviously, to roll on your transfers than if you feel like, okay, I need to move him, I need to change him. I don't have a good feeling about him. He's got tough fixtures coming up, et cetera, et cetera. But I don't think, I think the incentive of having all those free transfers, so up to five of them is really, really good. So for me it's actually the other around kels. I felt like, ok, yeah, I want to keep them a bit longer and then I can have three free transfers in one game week or four in one game week or even five, which is amazing. Really. 

Kelly Somers [00:14:18]
Yeah, I wanted to do that, but then I had obviously the world's worst defense, so I had to. And that just felt like there was headache after headache coming up. But. Yeah, I know what you mean. I know what you mean. It's certainly making the game more interesting as well, which is always good. Okay, so we've said over 480,000 managers are currently wild carding. We expect that to absolutely shoot up. Um, so we often do this in international breaks, but we give you an idea of the best players to target on your wild card. And this is useful even if you aren't activating the chip because of course it basically just means we're going through the best players in each position. So we'll start in goal and for some reason I'm going to go to Sam on this. 

Sam Bonfield [00:14:51]
Why? 

Kelly Somers [00:14:53]
Because I spoke to Jules last twice. 

Julien Laurens [00:14:54]
So I feel like, uh, clearly your expertise over the last few seasons, this. 

Sam Bonfield [00:14:58]
Is my area of absolute specialism. The goalkeepers. I think this season we were hoping that there were going to be some really good 4.5 options and so far that just hasn't really been the case. I think in preseason most people were looking at going for a Flecken or a Henderson and if you were going in at that cheaper price point, or maybe even an Arreola, who you'd been really annoyed about at the weekend when he went off at half time. But I think for me, if you want to go for a 4.5 right now, I'd go for Flecken, even with Manchester City up next. Because after you get past the Manchester City and Spurs games, the Brentford fixtures are really nice then for a long time. So you have then West Ham, Wolves, Manchester United, Ipswich, Fulham, Bournemouth. It goes on and on and on and on and on. So that feels like the kind of run that you would want to invest in if you are going in the 4.5 bracket. But my honest opinion right now is that the value with the goalkeepers is coming in the more expensive premium ones, the Reyes or the Allisons. And I think I, if I was wild carding right now, that's what I would do. I'd go for David Reya. Uh, or if you think you'd prefer to use your three arsenal assets differently. So you would prefer to go for, I don't know, Saliba, Saka and Havertz, for example, or Gabrielle and Saliba as your double up defensively, then I get that. Maybe then you look at Alisson at Liverpool. But I think that's the only negative between going for one of those is it takes up one of those all important three slots from the two teams that you probably want to invest in most bar Manchester City. Um, and so right now I'd go Raya. But Flecken is the other option if you want to hold your arsenal spots for someone else. 

Kelly Somers [00:16:43]
Jules, looking smug. You've got Flecken, haven't you? 

Julien Laurens [00:16:46]
I've got Flecken. Uh, but to be fair, I thought he would have more points by now. And I've got Areola because, you know, Paris born and bred and he's my boy, etcetera. So there are players I need to have otherwise they won't be happy and they will cross with me. So I need to have him. I think it's a really, really interesting debate about goalkeepers because if you look at Edison even like who would have thought City could concede against Ipswich at, um, home, even west, I'm aware. And the fact that he doesn't do any savings because he has nothing to do in games really because they are that good already. And yet there's still two of those three first games of the season where they haven't kept a clean sheet and he didn't get the points that Alison, who hasn't considered a toll yet, has got. For example, Raya Allison at uh, the top. They may be where we expected them to be and fair enough. But for Edison, I think he's the one that really is disappointed. Not him personally, but overall, the fact that he doesn't m have more points at this stage after the three games that they had is quite surprising. 

Kelly Somers [00:17:40]
Okay, so do you agree that Flecken is the best 4.5 option if a manager is going to go that way for a cheaper keeper? 

Julien Laurens [00:17:47]
I think the best combo right now is Raya and Flecken. I think really if you have that kind of money for your two goalkeepers and you can go for it, I think them two are, uh, even maybe more than Alison. I would go Raya and Flegen. 

Sam Bonfield [00:17:59]
There's the other option is to go for Muric at Ipswich because they are top of the fixture ticker. Defensively from game week four to game week 15. So it depends on how much you trust Ipswich. Um, but actually defensively by the fixtures that they have, he would be the one to go with. So if you want to do pairing four and a halfs, then you could go for a Flecan with Murich. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:20]
That wouldn't be any temptation to go for Alison because he's kept. He's been keeping the clean sheets for Liverpool. Or is it a case that you'd rather have a Trent or a Liverpool defender? Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:18:29]
Yeah, I think that's the problem, isn't it, with Alisson, is that you've got Trent and you've got Robertson. And when you look at the numbers for those two, they are already looking like they're going to be the Trent and Robbo that we saw like two, three seasons ago when we were all like, oh yeah, let's go big at the back and we'll spend all this money on. On the defenders. It feels that way again with those two. Particularly with the way that Trent is inverting this season, the way that they're playing his set piece threat. All of that means that I am very. I'll be getting Trent this week that like whether I wild card or not, that's going to happen. So that would mean that I'm, um, locked on my Liverpool slots because then I've got Jota obviously, as well. And if I then did the Alisson pick, that would lock me out of having Salah at any point. And that feels like a position I really, really don't want to put myself in. Because then that definitely is a wild card because you're making multiple changes to deal with that issue. And I think that's the issue I have with Alison. He feels like it might be an unfortunate casualty of the fact that if I wanted to double up on the Liverpool defence, I would do it with Trent and Robbo because of the way that they're playing right now, or even Trent and Van Dyke because you just have that a little bit of additional threat that you don't really get with Alison. 

Kelly Somers [00:19:44]
Yeah, definitely something to think about in terms of how many players you can have from each of these top sides. You almost have to plan your city, your arsenal, your Liverpool slots in particular, don't you? Because you know at some point you're probably going to want to max out on them. Okay, so we've uh, we've pretty much in agreement, it sounds like then on the goalkeepers, Flecken, if you earn 4.5 with another option at Ipswich, of course, as well. And if you want to go bigger then David Reya looks the best option there at uh, Arsenal. Okay, defenders. Sam's already revealed she's going to be bringing in Trent Alexandra Arnold this weekend. I. Jules, would he make your top kind of wishlist for defenders? And who else would? 

Julien Laurens [00:20:17]
Yeah, I would love to. I mean we've said the Liverpool boys because they haven't conceded yet in the three games they played. So Virgil, Robertson, Trent, fantastic. Because they have, they're right at the top of the defenders with the most points naturally because they haven't conceded. And they've been really, really good as well on the ball for all of them. So the thing with Robertson and Verger, they're 1 million less than Trent. So Trent has 7 million with super high ownership, obviously because well done to the, I think 30% of managers who went with him, uh, who have him currently is great compared to I think ViRGIl uh, is 14%. And then Robertson is still a differential because he's less than 10% owned for now. I'm amazed, Sam, that none of them have gone up in price. So no plus 0.1 million on top of them. So trend is still at seven and Robertson and van Dijk still at six. So right now is the right time probably to bring one in if you want, before the price goes up. But yeah, uh, without a doubt they have, they are the three best defenders to have in the game right now simply because defensively they've been just perfect. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:26]
Yeah. Sam, who would you like to make the list? 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:30]
I fully agree with everything Jules just said and I think doubling that freaks. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:32]
Me out when that happens. 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:33]
Yeah, I know. It's weird, isn't it? 

Kelly Somers [00:21:38]
No, Jules loves it when it's a happens, though, because he's like, oh, I'm just nephew. 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:41]
Oh, he's got his book out for. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:42]
Those not watching on, uh, YouTube. M he's holding up his notepad. He says, jules, what does it say? 

Julien Laurens [00:21:48]
Talent, planning and vision. The key is they are the keys here, people. They are the recipe for success. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:53]
I imagine we've got a few new listeners actually. Um, this season. I hope so anyway. A few new listeners who maybe don't know that last year when we did ask Jules the secret to his rather staggering success, to be honest. 

Julien Laurens [00:22:05]
Logical, I would say logical. 

Kelly Somers [00:22:07]
And I. Yeah, apparently talent, planning and vision are the key. And he has got a notepad for winning our, uh, mini league. We did get him a notepad that says it. And he loves now that we are not only an audio podcast, also, visually, he's now celebrating. 

Julien Laurens [00:22:20]
I started seeing my fans here, uh, in my house. 

Kelly Somers [00:22:23]
He's waving to all of the fans, all zero of them, back to defenders. 

Sam Bonfield [00:22:26]
Sam? Um, uh, yeah, so I fully agree with yours on the Liverpool boys and I think doubling up on them, if I was wild carding, that's what I'd do. I'd have two Liverpool, Liverpool defenders right now. I just think that the way they're playing is madness. Then I probably would stick, I said when I was going into the season that I would be selling Pedro Poirot after game week two. Now, even with spurs defensive, um, fragility, I would still keep Pedro Poirot if I was wild carding right now. He has had eight attempts on goal so far this season. That's more than any other defender. And only Trent has created more chances for his teammates of the defenders than Poirot has. And it's only by one. Trent's created seven and Poirot has created six. The way that spurs are playing, Poirot is basically in the box most of the time. When I look for him on the pitch, I'm like, where's Poirot now? Oh, there he is, right on the edge of the box. He's having shots all the time. So I think I would be looking to keep him because spurs haven't kept clean sheets in two of their matches and he's been averaging 5.3 points per start. So when you consider the returns that hes getting and in two of the three games he hasnt kept a clean sheet, I think hes worth having in your team. So I would still go big at the back. Id have Trent, id have Poirot and then id have an Arsenal defender, at least one of them. Whether you want to go for Ben White and spend a little bit more money, my personal preference is for Saliba. Still, if you want to go Gabrielle instead, then thats fine. But yeah, I think having an Arsenal defender makes sense. They would have kept a clean sheet as well at the weekend were it not for that Declan rice red card. Im pretty convinced of that because it was only when they were changing their personnel around that they conceded. So I think we could have had two teams with three straight clean sheets and then wed be talking about doubling up on Arsenals defence in the same way that we are Liverpools. 

Kelly Somers [00:24:16]
Could this be the first point in the pod where you guys disagree? Would you keep Poirot on a wild cardinal? 

Julien Laurens [00:24:22]
Yeah, yeah, I agree with Sam again. Yeah. No, no. What bothers me is the fact that they will always concede this person because of the way they play. Yeah. No, no, no. But again, it's always the same. It's whoever you replace him with. If the guy who you replace him with gets more points than Poirot, then you've done the right thing. But, but I still think that Poirot is a good, is a good player to have in your squad because going forward, certainly, and I expect with the return of Solanke, well, I hope that Solanke will be the guy who will finally finish all the chances that spurs created for the players. So, you know, I think it makes sense if you think that spurs are going to keep scoring, attacking for sure, creating chances for sure, so they will keep scoring or being close to scoring. So for that, Poirot and whoever you want from the spurs attack, makes sense also. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:14]
Sorry if I missed you saying this, Sam. Um, have you suggested a four or 4.5 million defender? Because if we're going to go big, if we're going to have all these Liverpool boys, if you're going to keep Pedro Poirot just quickly, does that mean you would get rid of the likes of Gavardio? Because he's been a real headache. Yeah, that's rid of him. 

Sam Bonfield [00:25:28]
That's my plan this week. 

Julien Laurens [00:25:29]
Yeah, he's the big disappointment. Really. He's the one. 

Sam Bonfield [00:25:32]
Yeah, massive disappointment because he's not even inverting in the way that he did last season. Rico Lewis is doing that on the other side. So you're not getting any attacking threat, really, out of vardiol. They're not keeping clean sheets, but that was the same last season. They didn't regularly keep clean sheets towards the back end of last season. But Bardiel made up for it because he was getting attacking returns and he's not this year, so I'd lose him. That's what I'll be doing this week. Um, and I think there's two standout 4.5s now in the game, in my opinion. One that Jules sold a couple of weeks ago in Leif Davis. I think you would have him. 

Julien Laurens [00:26:05]
By the way, by the way, by the way. 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:08]
Here we go. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:08]
Okay, what's coming here? 

Julien Laurens [00:26:10]
No, you know my second assist theory, that they should get points. No, no, but listen, listen. The goal that infield scored at the weekend, the Liam de Lapp, great finish, great run with the ball that Davies got an assist for a yard. It's a yard pass. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:27]
An assist, an assist. 

Julien Laurens [00:26:28]
Jules a yard pass in his own half. And then Liam Delap has to literally run 50 yards, have an amazing shot almost in the top corner to score a goal. And Davis gets the assist for nothing. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:41]
Like I heard he thanked, I heard he ran back and thanked he didn't. 

Julien Laurens [00:26:45]
I was watching that game. I promise you he didn't. And any of us would have made that pass. 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:50]
If you're upset about this one, how upset were you about the Ollie Watkins assistant? 

Julien Laurens [00:26:54]
Um, no, to be fair, that one. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:58]
Who does this county and assist your sister, isn't it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:27:02]
Because both of those things, when I was watching these come through, I was like, Jules is raging by this point. 

Kelly Somers [00:27:07]
I said that on both of them. 

Sam Bonfield [00:27:09]
I was like, he will be furious because there was also another one. 

Kelly Somers [00:27:11]
That's what makes it so good though, Sam. When it happens, I'm like, yeah, because it was David. 

Sam Bonfield [00:27:16]
So it's like, this is brilliant. He sold him Trent. 

Julien Laurens [00:27:19]
I saw Trent the other day with Gary Neville doing some sort of interview I think for sky. And even Trent was saying, listen, the assistant there is assist and assist because he was talking with him and Robertson and taking kind of very kindly the make of Robertson saying like his assist is just a pass there. And then Mo Salah does something amazing, scores and then Robertson gets the assist. But Trent is right. Sometimes an assist is not an issue. Should not be given. Like, how can Davies get points for that? Or even, like you said, Watkins. Anyway, go back onto your Davies point. 

Sam Bonfield [00:27:48]
Yeah, so I'd have Davies, um, he's created three chances so far, putting twelve crosses. He's taken five corners. He's the first two game weeks of the season. A lot of people like Jules did, will kind of look at the first two games of the season and I get why people did it, moving to the Newcastle defence or moving somewhere else with it. But each started the season with the worst fixtures they could possibly have had. Like, it couldn't have got any harder than Liverpool and Manchester City. Now they're past those. As I said, defensively, they are top of the fixture ticket from game week four all the way through to game week 15. So there should be some clean sheets coming, there should be some more attacking threat because he is very attacking. We saw that in the championship where he got 18 assists last season. So I think I'd have him and then I'd absolutely keep Anthony Robinson, uh, from Fulham. Created three chances, put in ten crosses again, looking incredibly creative, uh, so far this season. So personally, I think I'm at the stage where if I was wild carding, I wouldn't have 4.0 unless I absolutely had to for budget purposes, he's missed. 

Kelly Somers [00:28:51]
Off my boy mosquera. He provides good points, don't you know? 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:55]
Big minus points. 

Julien Laurens [00:28:56]
Big minus points. 

Kelly Somers [00:28:57]
No, last week. Last week he made it to two points, which means for the whole season overall. Drum roll, please. He's got me one point because the two was minus two, and then it was the one point the first week I didn't play him last week. 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:11]
You'll be pleased with him. No, I mean, I don't. I think the 4.0s, you've got some playing ones as you've got Kelly, you've got Harvard Bellis as well. Sometimes they don't play Faz. And actually, he's probably the best one of the four. Uh. 

Julien Laurens [00:29:25]
.0S he's 4.1 now. Uh, because he obviously got a price. 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:28]
He's got a price wise, but he's probably the best. But I would try and find that extra budget to have two 4.5s because those 4.5s are looking really, really nice. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:37]
Okay, onto the midfielders, then. And this. This is interesting. Is Salah essential, Jules, if you're wild carding? 

Julien Laurens [00:29:47]
I think so. I really think so. I think everybody should get in. We discussed it in preseason, in the previews that we did. We were not really sure. Like we said earlier as well, like Sam said about how Liverpool play, I really thought that Liverpool would be less winger orientated, if you want. But then again, Diaz and Salah don't play as a winger exactly like it was on the club. They come inside far more. So now. I think we've seen exactly what this slot Liverpool is. And they would get better because he's only three games in. So slot and his team and his philosophy and the way they play the game, they will get better, all of them, collectively and individually. So I think now we know that Salah, even at 32, is a freak of nature physically and an amazing player, which we knew already before. But you think, okay, 32, new manager, probably potentially likely last season at the club, all of those things could have made us think, okay, maybe not. And also the fact that he's super expensive. So like we've said before, if you want Haaland and Salah, that means that will impact the rest of your squad. And when I tried, I was not really happy with the race. I should have been happy and I should have kept that draft, but I didn't like you, Kent. But yeah, I think Salah is a must have. And yeah, you can have Diaz, but I think the counter argument I would give to the Diaz option because it's much cheaper, obviously, than Salah is right now. If you had to say who's going to keep that consistency and those kind of numbers for the longest between Diaz and Salah, you would bet your house on Salah more than Diaz. I love Diaz, and he's a great player, but Salah is Salah. And I think Salah has done it for so long that right now, if you had to, between the two, choose who is going to be that good consistently this season for the long run, I, uh, would go for Salah ahead of Diaz. And just for that, it's worth the extra whatever, 4 million or whatever difference there is between them two, because I'm not sure if Diaz can continue like this, whereas for salah, you kind of know that he will continue like this. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:43]
Then where do the sacrifices come, Sam? Because ultimately, spoiler alert, I'm guessing we're all going to say you have to keep. 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:51]
Yeah, you have to keep Harlan. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:52]
So there's no way you can do anything. How do we keep Salah? 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:56]
You have to make big sacrifices in. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:58]
The Sakao Palma, right? 

Sam Bonfield [00:32:01]
Yeah. Ah, both of them. I think you have to sacrifice both of them if you want to make a draft that has. And that's where I was. If you think back to our preseason conversations, that's where we were. We were like, well, it's a team that doesn't have Saka in it. There's no arsenal attack, and, ah, I didn't feel comfortable about that either. Um, now, so far this season, I think what's really interesting is that I agree. I think Salah feels essential. And if you're wild carding, I think you kind of have to get him. He's already taken a price rise this week, so he's now gone up to 12.6. So you've got to find a little bit of extra budget now as well. That's making it a bit more difficult. And I can only see that continuing to go up over the next few weeks. Same with Harlan. He's rising. He's at 15, uh .2 now. Uh, so, again, that's problematic, but I think when you're looking at the midfield, if you really want Salah, which I think on wild cards, you have to, then you have to be prepared to go without Saka or any arsenal attacker in the midfield anyway. You maybe can afford to get to havertz up top. Um, but you can't have Saka in the middle. 

Kelly Somers [00:33:03]
Okay, so then if you can't have a saka, are you then going without midfield. Arsenal cover Sam. 

Sam Bonfield [00:33:09]
Yeah, because you can't afford Erdegarde either. So the only way to do it is to go with Declan Rice. And I don't think that. 

Julien Laurens [00:33:15]
Or you can try to sterling like somebody else Martinelli. 

Sam Bonfield [00:33:19]
You can, but it has no way to start. Yeah, exactly. 

Julien Laurens [00:33:24]
Yeah. That's not where they're going to cause you problems. 

Sam Bonfield [00:33:27]
So I think you have to basically go without Saka and probably take Havertz as a forward instead because it's that little bit cheaper than Erdogan is. So it helps you with your budget and that feels okay at the moment, but you would be without Saka. And, uh, I'll be honest, watching Liverpool not having Salah in my team feels awful. I wouldn't feel any better watching Arsenal without Saka in my team. So there's always going to be a big compromise to make, and it's just what that compromise is. If you are happy to go without Salah, then you can go for a dias. I do wonder whether the arrival of Chiesa might change the level of minutes Salah gets, because obviously, at the moment, Salah's been playing 90 minutes every week. He's not been substituted in that 60, 70 minutes bracket when the likes of Trent and Jotto and Diaz have all come off for the Gakpos and the Darwins and the Connor Bradleys, because he hasnt really had a like for like replacement for Salah that he could do that with, whereas with Chiesa he does have that now. So maybe we might see Salah coming off a little bit early. But look, uh, I, uh, honestly think that Salah in 60 minutes is still a player that youd want to have in your team. It is just what it is. Um, I think if you are having Salah, though, your midfield then has to look more like Mbuemo and Ese and players like that in that mid price bracket. And you have to just ignore basically anyone from Cole Palmer down to about Erdogan. 

Kelly Somers [00:34:53]
Cole Palmer feels like he's kind of finding some form at the wrong time. It is interesting, by the way, though, to see. I think it's just precautionary to see that he has left the England squad for this international break. I don't know. 

Julien Laurens [00:35:03]
There's a few. There's a few of them for all. For all countries that have done that. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:06]
Yeah. It always is in this early international break, isn't it, where there's kind of. They're still getting over the summer, I suppose, and haven't really got going for the season. Um, yeah, Cole Palmer, though, he's someone that I really want, and I was thinking, oh, my gosh, I've got to get him in. But like you said, it's impossible, isn't it, really, if you're going to go with Salah. 

Julien Laurens [00:35:23]
Yeah, I think so. And Saka and Palmer, similar amount of points, I think 25 for Palmer, 24 for Sakae. So they are where we expected them to be, really. And don't forget that. Ah, Cole Palmer had a really slow start of last season before having this incredible form. And for us, one of the reasons why I did so well, because I brought him in really, really early, to be fair. And then he had this incredible Runway, really, after November, never looked back and kept scoring and scoring and scoring and scoring. Um, but he was obviously much, much, much cheaper than what he is now. So it's again. And it's that balance where you go for, where you spend your money on. If you think that Salah will bring you more points, even if he's more expensive than Saka and Parma, that you can have instead, then go for it. But I think Liverpool will be very good this season. We've said it from the start, they will have a really good season. And now we know that Salah is in that kind of form. And Sam is right about Kiesa. Uh, I'm not even sure when Keza would be ready and how good he could be. And Salah is so fit that there's a player that hasn't, uh, even been injured in the last eight years or so, almost. So the guy can play 90 minutes and again and again and again. When, even when Champions league starts mid September, I'm sure he will be able to play every three days at the level that he's been at now. Even with that intensity, it's just incredible, really. So even if you don't play your wild card, find a way of getting Salah in. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:50]
Sam, this is probably a good point to mention, uh, in the pod that you did actually come up with a mo Salah draft and a Haaland draft, because, as we've said, none of us are bonkers enough to go without Haaland. And I think this is probably an interesting time in the pod to bring it up. Just so Jules mentioned the word balance there. Uh, it's getting that balance, isn't it, in terms of how much balance can you get in your team? And when you made this team, which we'll run through in a second, did you feel like it had enough balance? 

Julien Laurens [00:37:15]
It's a really good team, I think. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:18]
No, she doesn't. Sam's nodding. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:20]
I don't think it does have the bun. So, yes, I think it is a good team. And a lot of them are just in there for the price points that they give you. So the goalkeeper is a 4.5. You can go for whoever you like. You can go for flicking or wherever you want to be. But I think my issue with this team is that I've just spent the last however long talking about defenders and how big at the back feels like it's back. And you could double up on Trenton, Robertson, and you. You want Poirot and you want a couple of Arsenal defenders. This team does not have a single arsenal player in it because I can't get one in on. 

Julien Laurens [00:37:54]
But this team has Watkins, who you can replace with Havertz, correct? 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:58]
Yeah. So. Exactly. So you could save a little bit and it's just about price points, right? So you could take Watkins out and you could go to Havertz instead. It's going to save you a little bit of money, like 0.4. So that. .4 then you can put somewhere else and you could maybe upgrade one of the defenders. But equally, you are kind of locking yourself into these cheaper, uh, price points across the rest of the team because you are going big everywhere else. Now, the other thing is that this team also has Trent because for me, I feel like Trent is essential. You could go with a Robertson, Robertson instead, and then that would save you a little bit more money. And then that maybe allows you, if you do the Trent to Robertson and the Watkins to Havertz, that, uh, maybe gives you the budget to get. 

Julien Laurens [00:38:44]
That's 1.8 million because this .8 between Watkins and Havertz and a million between Robertson and Trent. So I think the team that you came up with is good and can be even better. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:54]
Sam, everyone's probably going, but we can't see this team tell us this team. So run through it. And I think that is an interesting point you made m where you said, this is a lot about price points, so it's not necessarily the exact players you'd have in each position. 

Sam Bonfield [00:39:05]
Yeah. So I think. And I did this as part of. You'll be able to see this on site as well. There's an article on. On the Premier League. So the, uh, scout article has this in it as well, if you want to look at it as well. But four, uh, .5 Verbruggen's there because actually the fixtures are quite nice coming up as well. And Herzl has said that he was planning to not rotate goalkeepers this year, so that's helpful. And then Trent pal, Torres and Davis with Kilman and Harbor Bella. So you do have to have that 4.0, um, defender there in this one. Salah Bowen. And again, Bowen, you could drop down slightly if you were happy to go for another. But I do love Jared Bowen. Yeah. And actually, he's been really good to start the season. Uh, Eze Semenya. And then Harry winks. And then up top, it has Haaland, Watkins and Welbeck. Welbeck. Could be jar Pedro, if you prefer, Watkins. Uh, as we've talked about. Could be Havertz. I think probably that's what I would do with this team. I would probably have it over, uh, Watkins. I just feel like that would probably give you slightly better balance and it gives you some arsenal as well and. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:10]
Some money in the bank. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:12]
Have you got money in the bank, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:13]
No. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:13]
No. Um, I like the Ezerpik because we've had to wait for him to come good. But he now feels like, hopefully, I'm, um, saying this is an Ezarona. Hopefully that means that his season is going to kickstart from here. And Semeno is an interesting pick as well. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:27]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:27]
Jules, what do you make of that? 

Julien Laurens [00:40:29]
Yeah, we said it. I think it was one of my differential for this week. 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:32]
The one you didn't go for. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:34]
What? I'm sure you didn't go for him. 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:35]
No. No, you didn't. No. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:37]
I think I deserve the one you locked in. 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:39]
Absolutely. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:39]
Sure. No, we haven't got any differentials this week and I was really curious about it. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:44]
He was on my list. It was on my list, so. 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:46]
On your list? Yeah, yeah, exactly. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:50]
Yeah, yeah. Producer Jesse, as well, loves, uh, Antoine Semeno, who's almost, you know, Cameroonian, but he speaks French. He's almost french, so almost one of mine. And. Yeah, yeah. Great. And I think Brighton, I think. Sorry, Bournemouth, who were not good at Everton and the miracle that happened in the last ten minutes of that incredible game, I'm not sure, can be repeated ever by any teams anywhere with Semeno or without Semino. But he's always in the right place at the right time when something comes up. He's good. And I think Bournemouth will not have a game like the one I ever done often. Um, so I like that. I think Evanielsson will get better for them, too, up front. So that would benefit the wide players, whether Semeno, Tavernier, whoever sinistera, whoever you want. So this. Yeah, I think Semeno is really good at his price. Take him. He could be benched easily. There's no problem with that. So, yeah, I think it's a, it should be a popular spot if you play wild card. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:47]
He's returned in every game so far this season. 

Julien Laurens [00:41:48]
Yeah, great. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:49]
Feels like maybe he's been overlooked a little bit, Sam, because we've all been talking about Emil Smith Row Morgan Rodgers, who by the way, are Jules. Uh, how frustrating is he becoming now? 

Julien Laurens [00:41:58]
Don't get me started on Ronaldo Brazilian Rodgers. Um, yeah, I mean, it's so, so good. And at some point he will return. By the time he returns, uh, we would, ah, all have sold into a club in the championship again. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:11]
Yeah, yeah. Um, yeah, sorry. That just reminded me of the Morgan Rodgers anger that I've had. Because every week I look at my team and I think I quite like that and I think Rogers could get points this week and he plays really well and gets absolutely nothing. But a player like Semenya has probably been overlooked, sam, um, because of the two players I mentioned, Samuel Smith, Rowan Rogers. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:30]
Absolutely. Yeah, I think so. And I think because of the fixtures being the way that they are for Aston Villa and people struggling to afford to have Ollie Watkins and Ollie Watkins also not being in the best form right now. Coming back from the summer with England, people have wanted another way into Aston Villa and Rogers has felt like the right one. Actually, the right option if you wanted to go for Aston Villa was to go for one who is better for XG and XGI. And really last week I spent so long faffing about which transfer to make who to go, and Kinkutoo and I ended up going for Rogers. Although I was very, very close to going Mbomo last week and I really regret the decision not to do that. But, um, I just liked the fixtures for Aston Villa in the next three more than I liked the ones for Brentford. Um, but yeah, I mean, look, if you've got Rogers, I don't think you can sell him either at the moment because you've got nice fixtures coming up. But I do think if you're on wild card and you want to stick at Villa, I'd move to Onanna instead. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:26]
Yeah, yeah, really good point actually. Onana's had a brilliant, brilliant start to the season there. Okay. So I think we've discussed most of the midfield there. Forwards wise. Let's just box off one forward. We're all having Erling Harland. You've got to spend and what's his price? He 15.2 now. 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:40]
Two now, yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:41]
Wow. So also there's an element there we talked about price rises before. You have to be have Erling Haaland and you've got a wild card. It kind of feels like you almost, because it would be really hard to get to him without doing major surgery on your team, wouldn't it? Does it feel like you have to get him now, Sam, or you are going to get priced out? Because imagine if he keeps going up. 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:58]
Well, yeah, and it feels like it could happen because he's still not that highly owned. The same with Salah. He's already taken a price wise, he feels like he's going to increase in price as well. And it does mean, and it's one of the problems with wild carding a bit later, uh, is that you do risk the price rises having, making it difficult for you to get those bigger assets if they keep continuing to rise. For me, I think Harlan is essential. I think you have to have him. I, uh, just think not having him, he's barely in game and yet then scores a hat trick. Like he's not running around loads, he's just in the right place at the right time. Everything about him is so confident and comfortable this season. Like, he looks like a player that's going to have his best season in the Premier League if he stays fit. And, yeah, for me, I think he just feels like a no brainer. And I guess the other benefit of wild carding is that if you don't have that money up top as uh, in, you've got a forward line that's maybe got like Watkins, Havertz and Jal Pedro in it, you gotta move money around. So that's gonna take a lot of transfers to take that money and put it up front. Whereas in midfield, you might not have to do it quite so much with Salah. If you've already got like a palmer and you're prepared to sacrifice him, or, I don't know, you've got KDB or a foden or someone like that, you might be able to tweak your money around a bit easier. But in that forward line, he's so much more expensive than everyone else that getting that budget is going to mean you have to, you probably have to wild card to get him. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:25]
Okay, so Sam put Watkins and Welbeck in her draft. I quite like those, but I personally, and I toyed with getting him the other week for Solanki and I didn't. I personally would like Havertz because also, if you're going to have a team that doesn't have saccharine. It goes back to, you would want Arsenal cover, like you'd want Villa cover as well. But you, it almost feels even more with Arsenal. You need some attacking cover. Would havertz make your front 300 wild card jewels? 

Julien Laurens [00:45:49]
Yeah, I think so. Ahead of Watkins, for example, and a few others. If you obviously don't have Saka or the Guardian midfield, you need an Arsenal player there, an Arsenal attacker there, and Javetz will miss chances. And we saw that against Brighton, for example, where he scored a brilliant goal, but then should have had really, a second one in that second half, even with ten men. So that's the frustration part of having him, I think, because he's still not yet a clinical striker and he might never be because he just has other aspects to this game that is great that Haaland doesn't have, for example, or even, even something like Solanke doesn't have. So I think Havard is great. The other one I would mention because, uh, again, it's amazing, but keep in mind that both Mbumo and Wisa had a really good start of last season. And then after that, kind of like, slowed down a bit. They were still very good, but they slowed down. But Johan Wisa is the fourth best striker, like, attacker, um, forward in the game right now, which blows my mind, not just because his Paris born and bred, and obviously he's amazing just for that, but because I don't think anybody would have said at the start of the season, with all the options that you have at prone with the Solange move, Watkins, after last season, Haaland, Havertz, um, you know, anyone that we saw would do so well, so early, so well done to him. Uh, so Haaland is on 41 points. Then you've got Welbeck, I think, on 24, who is the big surprise, for sure. And then, and then we saw on 21 and harvest on 22, I think. So well done. Still low ownership at, uh, 7% for wisdom cost. Ah, you only 6.1 million. So, uh, it's really, really good. Obviously, money wise, you might not be able to put him in your draft or in your wild card or in your team, but I think he's definitely someone to keep in mind. And he won't last the whole season. He won't have a season where he scores in every game or assist in every game. But for now, he's on top form, so it could be the right time to bring him in. 

Kelly Somers [00:47:44]
So who would you front three be, Jules? 

Julien Laurens [00:47:46]
So I'll go Haaland, Havert and Wisa, for example. I think that's a very well balanced, really nice. And Sam said about Brantford's, uh, fixtures coming up as well for Flecken in goal. And I think it's the same to say for Wisa. So I would be very happy with Haaland, Harvard and Wesa front III because I would have also salah behind, even without Saka, um, and Palmer, for example. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:10]
Sam, your front three, as you mentioned, is Watkins, Welbeck, and, um, I was trying to sort of memory, even though it's on my screen, Welbeck, Watkins and Haaland. But would they be the three that you would go with? 

Sam Bonfield [00:48:23]
No, I think. I think if I was going to lock in a front three on wildcard right now, it'd be Harlan, probably Havertz. And then the third one would very much depend on price because even Jalpedra and Welbeck aren't that cheap anymore. They've both taken two priorities, so they're at 0.7 now, which is making it a little bit more difficult. Um, but I think they're both options. I love the Vista pick. I had him on my list as well. I think he's brilliant. And if you don't have M Bono in midfield, then go with him up top instead. Like have one of them at least. Uh, I think we also have to kind of mention Nico Jackson at the moment because if you're not going, Carl Palmer, and you don't have any other Chelsea assets, then maybe Jackson might be an option. He's had six goal attempts. All of them have come from inside the box. Four of them have been big chances, got two goals. He's created four chances. He's actually all right. And in terms of, um, creativity amongst the forward, only Kunya at Wolves has been more creative than Jackson has been. So I think he's got to be in the conversation if you're going without Chelsea elsewhere because of the way that their fixtures are over the next few weeks. And then there's Solanki as well. If he gets fit again and it's again. It's, uh, if he gets fit again and when he comes back. But I think right now, this week, I do Haalanda have a properly jowl. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:34]
Pedro, Jules, very quickly, as it stands, are you keeping Solanki? 

Julien Laurens [00:49:39]
Yeah, because there's no reason why. Like, until we hear, we hear from Ange saying, like, oh, it's another two weeks or it's another three weeks, or it's more serious than expected. Oh, he's back training, looking great. And he will play against Arsenal at the weekend because that's the fixture coming up after the international break. Then and until we know for sure, there's no point right now unless you play your wild card and then that's sorted. But if you don't play your wild card, I don't think there's a point. Changing him now and using one of your free transfers or a minus four to get rid of Solanke when we don't really know what the latest is and there's two weeks for him. Well, a bit less now because this is Wednesday. But, uh, there will be like a week and a few days to make sure if he's ready or not to go because he might well be. And in their case, to go back to the point we made for Poirot, I think spurs create so many chances that Solanke will score goals this season. He will have a good season like a lot of the spurs attackers, from Madison Toussaint to Brandon Johnson and Poirot and maybe even udogi. So I would keep him then. But if Ange says, nah, it's another two weeks, mate, listen, mate, it's another three weeks. 

Kelly Somers [00:50:46]
I love that you want to do it, mate him because he always says that. 

Julien Laurens [00:50:49]
Um, then in that case, then, yeah, I think it would be time to sell simply because you can't afford to have somebody that expensive on your bench simply because he's flagged. So change him and then you can always bring him back later. 

Sam Bonfield [00:51:02]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:51:03]
Watch this space at, uh, Franchoglo's press conference, which is still quite far away, to be honest, because we're still only on the Wednesday of, uh, the first week of the international break. But, yeah, probably lots of managers with a similar dilemma there. Ok, that's where we're going to leave it. This week is international break. Jules, where are you off to? 

Julien Laurens [00:51:18]
Covering France games France Italy on Friday. Which is. Which is cool. On paper it's cool. I'm not sure the game will be that cool. But we see it's always a weird. 

Kelly Somers [00:51:26]
International break, this one, isn't it? 

Julien Laurens [00:51:27]
Yes. 

Kelly Somers [00:51:28]
Nations League. 

Julien Laurens [00:51:29]
But there's some good games, like look at England. Amazing fixtures for you to watch. Oh, you're in the b league, aren't you? Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah. So why is it Finland? Finland. England is great. Who would not want to watch Finland against England? 

Kelly Somers [00:51:41]
Well, uh, for the first international break in however many years, I'm either not having a baby or I'm not working on the games. 

Julien Laurens [00:51:47]
That's a good for you. You only do the tv channel that. 

Kelly Somers [00:51:49]
I did work for in these games. Don't have the rights for these games anymore. They've gone to another tv channel. So while I was very disappointed about that, if you're watching on YouTube, you may notice this is not my usual room. I'm in Portugal, so I'm very much having my own international break, so every cloud has a silver lining and all that. I got a holiday. Um, Sam, what about you? What are you gonna be doing over the break? 

Sam Bonfield [00:52:08]
Um, trying not to press the wild combustion. 

Julien Laurens [00:52:11]
Ah, you win. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:12]
So there is a chance you could do this by the next podcast? 

Sam Bonfield [00:52:15]
I don't think there is. No, I am really happy. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:17]
Make a better podcast if you could do it. 

Sam Bonfield [00:52:19]
Yeah, I know. It's the salad thing, isn't it? Like, I think that's just what's. I'm just enjoying the fact my kids have gone back to school and this in peace and quiet in my house. I can work happily at this point. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:27]
George is going to pretend that that's also something that he's feeling, but then he remembers that, uh, he's never around his kids anyway. 

Julien Laurens [00:52:32]
Yeah, true. I've got too many of them anyway. I'm not even sure when they go back to school, so they've been packed off. 

Kelly Somers [00:52:40]
On that. Uh, that's where we end the podcast, because I want to go enjoy the sunshine. Thank you very much. Um, the good news as well. No deadline to remember this weekend, so just enjoy watching those brilliant international fixtures, particularly those stellar England ones, cannot wait to see how they get on against. Was it Republic of Ireland and Finland? All jokes aside, I do still quite like watching them, to be fair, we'll be back next week. Barring a disaster, which will probably be a Julian Laurent shaped disaster, we will all be together. We'll be doing it in a studio. 

Julien Laurens [00:53:05]
I would be in the studio. 

Kelly Somers [00:53:07]
Uh, yeah, but you'll probably have another 17 podcasts and you'll give us a 17 minutes slot. But, yeah, hopefully we'll all be together next week, um, recording our first podcast in person of the season, which always maybe doesn't make any difference for you guys, but does for us. And of course, that will be on YouTube, as all of these podcasts, uh, are each and, um, every week that we preview in game week four, don't forget to rate and review us. We love it when you say nice things, we don't when you say horrible things. If you don't like this podcast, ignore that. See you soon. Bye.
