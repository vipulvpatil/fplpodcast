Kelly Somers [00:00:00]
One final FPL frenzy before the season starts. We discussed a Solanki shaped saga that means no salah are the draft dilemmas as we nail down our sides and some preseason predictions as Jules tries to defend his crown. Well, this is it. Game week one is finally here. Do not panic, though, if you're not sort of, because I'm certainly not. Kelly Summers here with you, back with the final FPL pod before the season starts and hopefully helping me and everyone else through Sam Bondfield and Julian LeBron. Jewel back from the Olympics. No excuses. Now you got to sort this team out. 

Julien Laurens [00:00:37]
Yeah, yeah, but it's, you know, I could. I'm multitasking, as you know. I can do the FPL and my team and the Olympics. You know what? The last four are covered on the Olympics. 

Kelly Somers [00:00:48]
Right. Okay. So I've been told to talk because through this, it's basketball. Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:00:53]
It's a Steph Curry and liberty, and now I can retiree. 

Kelly Somers [00:00:56]
I was gonna say, if you follow Jules on social media, you'll know that. Uh, would you say that's a career highlight or a life highlight? 

Julien Laurens [00:01:01]
Oh, yeah, yeah. 100%. Without a doubt. They were, like, literally there, Kelly. Like, almost. We played in the same team. So as a massive basketball fan and NBA fan, to cover them was just one of the best moments of my professional career, for sure. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:17]
Well, I'm very pleased with you, but, Sam, bring this round to FPL, will you? Are you ready? 

Julien Laurens [00:01:20]
I was just saying, because often you wonder, like, what sports? So now I've done swimming, running, and. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:25]
Athletics and that also, you didn't make people wait until the end of the podcast. You did it at the beginning. So now everyone's switched off already. 

Sam Bonfield [00:01:31]
We'll get some football skills at the end of the podcast. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:35]
Sam, uh, bring us back round to FPL because we're a couple of minutes in and we're now talking about the wrong sport. We're going to get in trouble. 

Sam Bonfield [00:01:40]
Yeah, it's nearly there now, isn't it? And I think this is the bit of preseason where everybody either goes, I'm happy, and they settle, or goes into meltdown. 

Julien Laurens [00:01:51]
Yeah, nobody's happy, shorty. 

Sam Bonfield [00:01:53]
Do you know what? At the beginning of the weekend, I was like, I think I'm settled. And then I really realized you weren't, and then I went, who settled? 

Kelly Somers [00:02:00]
I'm sorry, but who's settled? At the beginning of the final weekend of preseason friendlies, before the community shield, before signings, injuries, games? If you say you're settled, you're lying. 

Sam Bonfield [00:02:11]
Well, it's the settling in terms of like I feel like this team's quite good and then obviously the last preseasons play a part. But uh, it's also the signings that have had a massive impact on my team because suddenly I'm now like, okay, everything's gone out window. 

Kelly Somers [00:02:25]
I get the feeling it might be one signing in particular. Jules, which signing do we think that might have affected? Sam? 

Julien Laurens [00:02:33]
Could it be somebody who plays in white and came from a club from the south that you know well, Kelly maybe to north London club? 

Kelly Somers [00:02:42]
I think it could be. And hands um up. We can do this now because we're on YouTube. Hands up if you've already got him in your FPL team. For the interest of those of you listening on podcast, there's a little your first reminder of the day we're also on YouTube. We have all put our hands up and that is not surprising, is it Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:02:58]
Um, no, because if you can have spurs as number nine for seven and a half million, by the way, we're. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:03]
Talking about Dominic Solanke, I realized we didn't actually name him Dominic Solanke. 

Sam Bonfield [00:03:07]
Yeah, before it was officially announced he was in my team and then I sat there refreshing the app going put him in a Spurs shout. Go on, do it quicker. And then eventually he landed in a Spurs shout. I was very happy about that. But yeah, I think if you can have the spurs number nine for seven and a half million, it makes for the perfect third forward. And I can see a lot of teams being changed quite substantially to afford that because obviously for a lot of people, if you had a Joe Pedro or you had a Chris Wood or you had a muniz down there, you're going to have to find a little bit of extra budget. So that's the problem I had this week. It was just I needed to find some budget from somewhere else. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:45]
I think it would also affect a few of those people who were getting quite excited. You included Sam, about the potential of an out of position spurs midfielder. So I presume we'll talk about your team in a little bit more detail later on. We'll also talk about some of the other new signings in the league later on. Um, I just wanted to mention Solanki because we've got a personal interest in the podcast and it does feel like actually all of a sudden we might have a bit of a template front three for lots of people. Now, early shout out. First shout out of the season. By the end of the season last year, I knew the pod mini league code off by heart. But we've got a new one now that I need to learn. So this is your first invitation to join myself, Sam and Jules and all of the rest of the listeners in playing against us this season. Can you beat Jules, myself and Sam? Certainly hope so. The code is q seven, y c o zero. So that's like a little over letter and then zero, q seven, y c o zero. Please do join. Hope to see lots of you in there. Okay, um, let's reflect then on the final round of preseason friendlies and the one that probably Jules tells us the most, particularly given the fact that it was between two of the biggest teams in the league and it's the most serious, official, unofficial friendly. If you're going to call it friendly silverware, I'm talking about the community shield. Manchester m City versus Manchester United. What did you take away from that? 

Julien Laurens [00:05:03]
I, uh, thought it was a big kg for 90 minutes, no extra time. Obviously we went straight to penalties. I expected it to be. To be fair, uh, neither team really starting their strongest eleven for obvious reasons. Some players just coming back from injured from holiday, some injured, some new signings there and there. Uh, but you got to see still little bit that would, I think, benefit us in the game. For example, we saw, I think again, a very good Oscar Bob, uh, which is, we've mentioned him, we've highlighted him already in our first three shows, who I think is a very interesting player. We saw that Haaland didn't score again, but he never really scores in Community Shield and yet always starts the season well. So that's not. I don't think that's a worry. We saw Alejandro Garnacho coming on for United, scoring and doing really well, not so much Marcus Rashford, who had some chances that I didn't take, which again, I think is interesting for the game. If you were thinking about getting Marcus Rashford too. So I thought it was a very still interesting game despite not being the most entertaining. 

Kelly Somers [00:06:03]
Sam, what about you? What did you take away from? I was particularly interested in Manchester City for this one. Although the whole thing of players coming back from international doesn't really help us. 

Sam Bonfield [00:06:13]
With this game, it does make it more difficult. And I think because it's been an international summer, it has made that part of FPL a little bit more difficult. I mean, Oscar Bob, he did continue to impress again. And, you know, he's now played in 92% of the minutes that Man City have played in preseason. He's got two goals and three assists in that time. More minutes than anybody else has got for Manchester City this summer. So what does that tell you? Well, it's difficult with Pep, isn't it? Because you never really know what he's going to do. But he has looked good this preseason and got enough minutes to suggest that he will get the nod for game week one. So if you do want to go for the cheap option in midfield then I think you have that there. I do worry a little bit longer term about how that Man City team's going to look when you get, you know, the likes of Foden and Bernardo Silva and those guys coming back into the starting eleven and obviously grealish have been having a good preseason and then wasn't available for the Community Shield. So yeah, it was an interesting learning point. It put Bob firmly back on my radar. Harlan, uh, I agree with what George just said. I'm not worried about him. He's caught a brace in the last two game week one. So just because he didn't have do a lot in this one doesn't worry me too much. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:20]
Yeah, the last two seasons he got two goals and 13 points on the opening day. So yeah, don't get too panicked if you are Oscar Bob. To me, Jules feels very much like a Julian Laurent signing something. Considering him. 

Julien Laurens [00:07:33]
Uh, I've got him in the squads already. I've said that before. Yeah, of course, a five on five I think is a good enabler to have then. I still think that. I think he will start game week one and it's against Chelsea away. So we said it's a difficult fixture to start with with City, but I think he will start, I think on um, that right hand side where him as a left footed attacking midfielder or attacking player is really interesting because since Mahrez left and even mares last season was not the best, you've got Bernardo there. But I think Bob is more of a player that suits that position than Bernardo. Silva really for me is more of a central player. So I think there's a role for him in his team. Okay, maybe not consistently for the whole season, 90 minutes every time because he will still be, I think, more of a squad player than a regular starter, guaranteed starter. But for now, in terms of form and like Sam said, who's been playing, who's just coming back, who is not really fully fit to start a Premier League match of the calibre of Chelsea away, for example, I think he's there and he's been City's best player really in the summer so far. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:40]
What about Manchester United, Sam? Because I was really interested in how Marcus Rashford was going to do. I feel like he's got a point to prove. Jules mentioned it there, uh, missed m some chances is he or anyone else from Eric ten Harkerside worth investment? 

Sam Bonfield [00:08:56]
Yeah, I mean, Rashford, I was watching him because actually he's priced really nicely in their game. And I think, actually I was quite disappointed with him because he was getting in the right places, doing the right things, and then just not finishing any of them. And the one chance in particular that really he should have put away and Marcus Rashford of two seasons ago would have put that away with his eyes closed. And so I don't know. For me, there's still very much a wait and see that game. It's the opening game of the season, right, against Fulham. Um, I don't see that being an easy game for Manchester United by any stretch of the imagination. They've got some defensive issues in terms of injuries. So I'm looking at them thinking, I feel like they're a team that if they start well, in the sort of opening two or three game weeks, then I might look to invest because they're not difficult to get to in terms of their price points. So I do think you can afford to just wait and see on Manchester United, and that's what I'll be doing. Because apart from Garnacho, nobody really stood out, uh, from the red side of Manchester in that one. For me, anyway. 

Kelly Somers [00:09:53]
You agree, Jules? 

Julien Laurens [00:09:55]
Yeah. Uh, but I have to say I was convinced by Garnacho enough to bring him back into the squad where he was first, and then, yeah, I think he will start this weekend. I think he would just be United's, um, biggest threat, let's put it that way, going forward more than anybody else. And I think he's got. The summer has been a good summer for him. I mean, even the last 18 months have been an incredible journey for him. And I think he's still so young and still very raw in many respects, but has something very special, I think. And this team is still being built in a way. Uh, there's some new signings, there's still ten hag, but ten hag has a lot to prove himself too. And I think Garnad show is the one value in that team that, you know, I think he's going to deliver, if there's one to deliver, even more than Bruno, more than we can look at defenders, we can look at Hauland we can look at, uh, Zergzy, we can look at all those different options. For me, Garnaccio is the one who is the most established in a position, knowing exactly what to do. Everybody knows his strength, as we saw on his goal and the competition. And that's why his goal is such a Garnacho goal, such a Galantro goal, that this is what he does so well. And I think he can do that all season. So at, uh, his price, I think it's a no brainer if you want a United player, if you don't want a United player. But I was quite convinced, uh, by the way, United play against City in that community Shield. I didn't expect them to play at that kind of level already in the season. So I think it's going to be a very good season from United, from a United point of view. And I think Garnacho will be the key in that. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:26]
Jules, I've got some good news for you actually, because you, uh, know, before when you were listing having Oscar Bob, I think you said he was 5.5 million. He's actually only five. 

Julien Laurens [00:11:34]
Only five. Sorry, I thought he was five or five. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:36]
That's all right. But it means that you've got 0.5 million more than you thought you had. 

Julien Laurens [00:11:40]
Exactly. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:41]
You see money in the bank. Okay, moving on to the other preseason matches then, um, because it wasn't just the community shield that took place last weekend, and it's one of the final games for Premier League sides where they kind of show their hand a little bit more. We get maybe a bit more of an indication of what they'll look like on game week one. The one I was most interested in and played most attention to, I'm going to be honest, was Liverpool. Because I said this time last week that I was struggling to get my Salah in. I'm still struggling to get my Salah in. It's an eternal problem that so many of us have got. I'm, um, leaning towards Diogo Jota. Sam, what do you think of that? 

Sam Bonfield [00:12:16]
Yeah, the Dominic Solanke, who I'm sure we'll talk more about in a little bit. Bringing him in has upset my team even further because it means that I. Well, it has. Because it means that in order to afford him, I've had to take some money out of someone else. Because I was absolutely certain I didn't want to take that money out of Salah. I now have an even weaker midfield than I started with. Last week is basically Salah or bust now. And I'm looking at that team and I'm thinking I need to find a bit more balance here. Because if I get two game weeks into the season and players like Garnacho have done something really good or players in the eight and a half or you know, Arsenal, who I'm terrified about not having play really well, then I am um, really going to struggle to bring them in so I need to find a way to balance my team and Jota feels like the most obvious way of doing that I mean obviously he gets the goal in this one salah didnt get any attacking returns but salah was still good in this game he still had plenty of good opportunities and could have easily got something out of it. So its not um, that I think that Salah is a bad pick it's just the more these new signings come in, the more it changes the way that the rest of your team looks, the more you have to find compromises and I'm not sure how far I'm prepared to compromise on Salah yet. I'm still not 100% sure that I'm willing to go that far with my compromises but I do think that Jota is looking like a really nice alternative and as we said last week, he does look like he's going to start in the number nine I mean Liverpool played two matches that day and it was Jota who started in I guess what you would call the first team match and yeah so Jota does feel like a good option if you don't have the budget for Salah for sure. 

Kelly Somers [00:14:02]
Can you get round Salah by having Jota Jules or are there any other options there in the uH, Liverpool midfield? And do we need a Liverpool midfielder? 

Julien Laurens [00:14:10]
I think we need a Liverpool player, whatever that is. It could be a defender, could be a midfielder, could be a forward. It doesn't matter so much. I think you need one there. I think they will have a really good season with Arnis slot and already they look really good when the guy has been in charge for a month. So I think you need someone I tried to put Salah in before the Solanke move and I just. The rest of the team outside of Haaland and Salah just didn't make me happy. I was just not convinced by it so I decided no Salah and I think if you decide no Salah, you can try like Sam and try to make it work for me I didn't think that it worked if you can't make a Salah, Jota for me is the obvious kind of replacement from a Liverpool point of view and the goal he scored, which was a fantastic finish and we know the talent is not the problem. The problem is the fitness because he always keeps getting those little injuries there and there. But Jota, to start the season, he looks fully fit, he's ready. As we've said, they have really ipswich away. It's hard to do a, uh, better fixture than that one, really. I could have been at home, but that's it really. So I think Jota, uh, if you can't make Salah, if you don't have that kind of money, m because you also want Holland and one or two other premiums go for Jota. It's a great alternative, more than an alternative even, because I think if you compare the price and the value, I would rather have Jota than Salah. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:33]
Yeah, it does feel like that, doesn't it? Because he is so much cheaper. 7.5 million compared to 12.5 for most salah. That's a whole 5 million. Good maths for me. I know. Um, elsewhere, other headlines, as we know regular listeners will know, math is not my strong point. Um, other headlines, someone we've spoken about a lot. And Kunke was benched for Chelsea's final preseason match. Jules, how much do we read into that? 

Julien Laurens [00:15:55]
Uh, I'm not sure how much. Yeah, he's tough. And Chelsea is still a work in progress. Very much so. 

Kelly Somers [00:16:02]
We say under Maresca, are you any more impressed than you last were? 

Julien Laurens [00:16:06]
Not really, no. I'm just very excited to see maybe when the season starts properly, things will get in place better. But what a first game, as we said, to host city at Stamford Bridge would be very difficult. And I mean, Pedro Neto, who we'll talk about later, is also an interesting one from a Chelsea point of view, but, yeah, I don't think Nkunku for me right now is, uh, the answer. 

Kelly Somers [00:16:33]
Yeah, I think we're seeing him fall out of a lot of people's drafts, aren't we? Good to see Joao Pedro back in scoring. Sam, I almost feel like from what we said before about the forwards, it might be a little bit too little, too late. 

Sam Bonfield [00:16:43]
Yeah, I watched the community shield, um, on Saturday with AZ and of course, AZ is a massive, massive Brighton fan. He comes on here sometimes and we said exactly the same thing. We were both like, oh, Jal Pedro back in scoring. That, uh, feels like a really great option. Oh, except that we all want Haaland and Isak and now we all need Solanki as well. So it's difficult to find a spot for him. And it's a shame really, with Jal Pedro because we thought he was going to be good when the price came out. Then he missed pretty much all of preseason with this rib injury that he had, didn't travel away with. Brighton comes in, uh, plays, what, 45 minutes in this game and scores. It's one of those, isn't it, where if you are absolutely set that you have to have Haaland and you have to have Salah and you want a Trent or somebody in there as well, then players like Jal Pedro are probably going to be the way that you have to go. But we should just be a little bit mindful that Danny Welbeck has actually had a really good preseason as well. Yeah, I mean, he's got three goals and, um, an assist. He's played 69% of the minutes over the course of the preseason, 250 minutes of preseason. So in terms of like match fitness and being ready to go this season, Danny Welbeck is in the right place for them. So if you are going for Jalpedro, there is the Welbeck problem, uh, potentially just sitting there as well. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:01]
Yeah. Worth, uh, thinking about him. Someone that I mentioned last week potentially getting rid of. And then Sam, you made me feel so bad about. I didn't. 

Julien Laurens [00:18:08]
Um. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:08]
Eberici, ezza. He's not had, uh, the most exciting preseason, but he was away with England and it is just preseason. He's still in my team. Jules, what have you made of his preseason? He's so popular in the game, isn't he? Do you think 7 million people should be looking elsewhere or is he still really good value? 

Julien Laurens [00:18:27]
No, I think there's, um. I think there's good value there. I think there's a case to make for him in your team, especially with Olisse leaving. You would think that even more the kind of attacking game of palace will rely on him, so he will be even more involved. I think it's a difficult summer for him because one, as you said, he was with England at the euros. Not that he played much, but that means the holiday starts at the end. So he misses preseason for most of it, comes back kind of. You play catch up a little bit. If you're established, uh, international and everything, you're used to it. You know how it works for him. It's the first one, really. The other thing is, I think I just wonder how much he thought maybe he was going to move out of Crystal palace this summer and if maybe that can have a bit of. A bit of an impact on his performances. I don't know, I just think that there's other options for me lac jota that is just slightly more expensive, that are more guaranteed in bracket, uh, for returns than Eze right now. I just don't know fitness wide ways exactly. I don't think palace have had an amazing preseason either. Bella West Ham, who we'll talk about later with Fulcrug. So I'm just. Yeah, I'm not too sure. But later in the season, no problem. Because if he shows that he's on great form and that palace are doing well, like the finished last season, then yeah, for sure. Right now I'm not too convinced. 

Kelly Somers [00:19:54]
Sam, are you still as locked on him? 

Sam Bonfield [00:19:56]
Yeah, I am. I think so. I really like the fixtures for Palace. I think he'll have to be talismanic in his approach this season because, you know, without Alize, he will be their focal point in the midfield. So I'm still there. And I also think that by going in with him, if it doesn't go well, it's relatively easy to move around. And I do still believe that game week one should be about price points for a lot of the picks that you make. It's about making sure that you have flexibility across your squad to move as much as you need to in game weeks. One, two, three. You know, up until the point where you choose to play your wild card, it's having those little moments where you can go. Eze has not performed well. I'll get in a different player in this six to seven price point, or if I've kept some money in the bank, maybe I can get up to a bow. And if he starts the season well, or an Anthony Gordon or whoever it is, I think Eze will have a good season, whether he hits the ground running. I mean, he got, what, 61 minutes, I think, in this one. So enough time to kind of get his legs back in after the summer. But I think for me, he's still staying. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:58]
I tell you what, at this point, let's go through our teams as they stand because we've hinted at some of the changes or some of the players that have survived our tinkering so far. Sam, run us through your team then. I'm saying run us through. In fact, tell us your changes from last week and then we'll go through your teams just so that the regular listeners can hear where you're at. 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:15]
I mean, there's been quite a lot of changes, to be fair, because, uh, I needed to find a route to, uh, Solanki. So I made some changes and they were minimal. And it basically involved, um, taking the 0.5 million that I had in the bank, investing that up top and then finding another million. So I basically took Kulosevsky out and swapped in for Smith row. So that was the easy route to doing it. But that does, as I said before, leave me with a team that I feel is week across the midfield in terms of price points to move elsewhere because it's basically Salah and then Ese is the next most expensive and then after that it's budgets all the way. So my current draft doesn't have Salah in it anymore, which I know we. 

Julien Laurens [00:22:01]
Had to wait 22 minutes for this bombshell. 

Kelly Somers [00:22:04]
No, she did allude to it earlier. I thought this was coming. Jules, we've turned her. For weeks she's been trying to turn me into the salad club and saying we need him. And now, and now here we are. All it takes is assigning for spurs, unsurprisingly. And it's all changed. 

Julien Laurens [00:22:19]
Yeah, Moore would be very disappointed in you. But anyway, let's go. 

Sam Bonfield [00:22:22]
I know he's not going to be friends with me anymore. Um, but it does. The thing is, I was looking at kind of the basic point was, who do I think he's going to score more if I have Salah? And then, you know, somebody like a, uh, I don't know, a budget player in the kind of six, five and a half bracket. Do I think they can outscore Jota and Saka? Because that's the alternative. Uh, I think Saka will have another really, really good season. It gives me an arsenal player that I've been massively lacking in every draft that I've had so far. Uh, so yeah, my actual new draft has changed quite a lot. There's very few of them that have go through that. 

Kelly Somers [00:22:58]
Then go through that from the whole way through. Go through your whole squad. 

Sam Bonfield [00:23:01]
Okay, so by not having Salah anymore, it means that I can afford to have Saliba. So I've got Henderson backing goal, um, and then a back three of vardiol, Saliba and Pedro Porro midfield of saka, Jota, Eze and then Smith row and then a forward line of Harlan, de sac and Solanke with a 4.0 goalkeeper on the bench, um, and then Barcoe, Winks and Robinson from Fulham as the three subs. So the subs bench is weak, but they are all players that are going to start the season. 

Kelly Somers [00:23:34]
Okay. You said to me the other day, didn't you, when we were on the, uh, fantasy show that you thought our teams were going to be quite similar. They are quite similar. And I think they'll probably end up being more similar. Jules, what about yours? 

Julien Laurens [00:23:43]
So I made three changes compared to last week. Diogo Jota coming in for Anthony Gordon who, because I've got Isak at France. I just feel that uh, the double, as long as I've got one of them too, I think it's fine because I think both of them will have a really good season like Newcastle. So that was the only way I could do Jota was to get rid of Gordon. So I think that's fine. Garnaccio for Elliot and then Solanke for Darwin up front. 

Kelly Somers [00:24:11]
Okay, round three, whole squad then. 

Julien Laurens [00:24:12]
So Flecken, Areola are the two goalkeepers and I've got Poirot, uh, Barco, Saliba, Konsa and Davis from Ipswich in midfield. Saka, kudos, Jota, Garnacho and Bob. And then Solanke, uh, Haaland and Isak. 

Kelly Somers [00:24:26]
Okay. It feels like we've got quite similar starting eleven s, just with maybe some different benches. Joel's got a few differentials in there though. Um, my defence is not set and it probably will. I think I'm gonna have to sacrifice Gordon as well to enabled me to upgrade my defense. I'm on Arreola and Flecken as well. Gehy, guardiol, Konza, Barso, mosquera. Then in midfield I've got saka, Jota, Ezza, Gordon, winks and then up from the front three that everyone's got Isaac, Solanke and Haaland. On the topic of the front three, Jules, this time last week you were also saying you were very excited to see how much the new west Ham man Fulcrug was gonna cost. What did you make of the price that he came in up? 

Julien Laurens [00:25:07]
Uh, yeah, 7 million. That was a little bit this. I thought he was going to be slightly less. I thought he could be there for 6.5. He's got a tooth missing. So just for that I thought, okay, knock him 0.5 million and that's fine. But I guess because you feel sorry. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:22]
For him also he can have a fixes too. 

Julien Laurens [00:25:24]
Yeah. And I think he loves the fact that he doesn't have a tooth there. So, you know. But anyway, he's a Champions League finalist, he's a uh, you know, euro. Whatever they did with Germany I can't even remember. So it's fine, it's fine. 7 million, I get it. But when I see a Solanke at uh, 7.5 who is primarily proven scored 21 goals last season, even if with Solanke you just never really know, in terms of consistency, because he's had some bad season in the Premier League too. I still would rather pay the little bit more for Solanki than go for full. Krug and West Ham, by the way, have had a really bad preseason, which doesn't mean anything when the season starts. I'm just saying that they haven't been great and the L'Hopetegui so far and Fulcrug has just arrived, hasn't really played yet with his new teammates and stuff. So I think it feels like Solanke is a safer bet anyway. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:13]
You feel like you've got a little bit of optimism around West Ham though, the fact that you've gone with Kudis in midfield. 

Julien Laurens [00:26:17]
M um, yeah, because I think what they've building, certainly in terms of recruitment, is really, really good. And I like L'Opetegui a lot. And again, I'm not sure how much you read into preseason performances, matches. Not everybody was there, not everybody was fit, all of that. So we'll have to see. But the good thing with Kudos as what Sam was mentioning a little bit for Eze, uh, is that if Kudus doesn't start well, it's easy to challenge. There's a lot of 6.5 million midfielders who are very good in the game. So if Kudus is not there off West Ham, just take a bit of time to hit the ground running, then you can easily swap him for somebody else who's good, who started well. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:51]
Yeah, West Ham, our team haven't really looked at Sam, uh, automatically I looked at, uh, Bowen's price when he came out because of what he did last season. But the whole international thing and the fact that he's at a congested price point in the game meant that I didn't consider him for long at all. Have you looked at any of their players at all? 

Sam Bonfield [00:27:08]
Yeah, I mean, I always look at Jared Bowen and I think he is so important to that West Ham team. M and you know, he has only played 67 minutes in preseason. He only played in the last one. And in that game he got a goal and an assist. He always has that impact on that West Ham team and he's a big game player. Right. Uh, you know, I think when you look at it, it's a difficult game to start the season against Aston Villa. He scored against them last time around and got 16 goals and six assists, 182 points. Like, I think Bowen went a little bit under the radar last season and I think he will go a little bit under the radar again this season and it won't be through any fault of Gerald Bowens. It'll be because we're all talking about these other players in the same price points because of jota and everything else. So I am definitely looking at West Ham. I always like Max Kilman. I think he's always a good pick in fantasy and under lopateghiside, usually they are quite solid defensively. And so if they start the season with some more solid defensive performances than we've seen in pre season, then there'll be a defence that I look to invest in. Because unlike you too, I'm not going to go for Arreola this time around. But, yeah, I mean, um, I'm all eyes on West Ham. They're another team, a bit like Manchester United for me, that I'm going to wait and see how they start the season before I invest, but they're definitely on the radar. 

Kelly Somers [00:28:24]
Jules, you mentioned him m earlier. Uh, Pedro Neto has gone to Chelsea for big money. We know what Pedro Neto could do in a wolves team that wasn't the most attacking at times. He's a brilliant, brilliant player, but there feels like there's quite a lot of uncertainty in terms of where he fits into this side, how Chelsea are going to do. As you've said, would he be someone that's just on your watch list at the moment? 

Julien Laurens [00:28:46]
Yeah, I think so. The problem, as you say, is the fitness, really. Last season, even last season, he had a good season because I think there's nine assists in the Premier League and three or four goals, something like that, in 24 games. But there's more games that he missed through injury. The two seasons before that, it was even worse. I think he played ten games and 15 games or something like that. In the Premier League, you need players who are reliable in this game, otherwise you can't keep changing and transferring, et cetera, et cetera. So, Neto, in terms of talent, no problem. But I've got issues with the fitness and the question mark around his fitness all the time. And also the fact that, as we've been saying, Chelsea right now, ah, are still very much a work in progress and they've got a lot of options. They're going to buy more players. They've signed a lot of players already. I'm not sure if Mareska knows where his strongest starting xi is right now. So, yeah, I would not put him in the squad now, but just keep an eye on him. And just to finish on West Ham descent, Jean Claire to Dibo, the, uh, french centre back who's only 4.5 million? No, don't worry, 4.5 million. I think he's really, really interesting and he's from Paris and we even played in the same club, uh, in Paris. Not the same time because I'm slightly older than him. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:00]
Slightly. 

Julien Laurens [00:30:01]
Just the 20 years but that's fine, you know. Uh, but we still played for the same team so yeah, he's a Lila boy like me. So um. Are you going to bring him in the game? Yeah, maybe. I'm going to do my all Paris uh starting eleven as you know. Ah, very soon. Um, but yeah, yeah, I think, I think, I think he's got a really good case because like Sam said if they are solid defensively which I think l'Petigi can do easily then I think at that price Todibo becomes a very, very attractive uh, pick. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:32]
Sam, someone that you mentioned is in your team now. Emil Smith Rowe. I can't remember because my memory is useless. Had Smith row signed for Fulham at the time of our last recording? I feel like he had. 

Julien Laurens [00:30:42]
We mentioned him, I think. 

Sam Bonfield [00:30:43]
Yeah, I feel like we mentioned him. We knew that he was, it was maybe happening. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:47]
Yeah, yeah. So I think we spoke about him but his price point for what we know he can produce at Arsenal. I'm not surprised that you've brought him in because he could be big in that Fulham side and also you had Muniz at one point didn't you, in your draft? Obviously a lot of people now aren't going to have Muniz but will maybe have wanted him as third forward. Smith Row is another nice way of getting into that Fulham attack and maybe getting a share of the goals potentially that Muniz could score because you'd presume that he will link up with Smith Row as well? 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:16]
Absolutely. And I think what you just said is exactly how my thought process went. It was oh, I need to take out minnies because I want to put in Solanke but I don't want to de invest in Fulham because I like the idea of having Fulham for those opening fixtures that they have and we spoke about fixtures a lot last week and they're so nice for Fulham to start the season that I still wanted to be invested there. So yeah, I mean he's played 126 minutes for them in preseason. He's got a couple of goals for them already. M like you said, we do know what he can do. He has done that at Arsenal in the past. He's been so unlucky when he's been at Arsenal with injuries and then with getting back into the team because Arsenal have been playing so well that it's been difficult for him to kind of break through. Yeah. I mean, what, last season he made three starts, came on a further ten times off the bench. But when he was coming off the bench, he was coming off in like the 68th, 78th, you know, 80th minutes. It wasn't like he was getting loads of time, but he did average five points per start when he was Arsenal last time around. So if he can bring that form that he has and stay fit and get regular starts and all of those are big potential, but I suppose. But in that Fulham team I would expect that he will get regular starts then I think he could be a really, really nice option and he's cheap. So from that perspective, I think at five and a half he offers good value for a starter in that Fulham team with great fixtures. 

Kelly Somers [00:32:37]
Any other non parisian signings, Jules, that, uh, I've forgotten to mention or that you want to shout out? 

Julien Laurens [00:32:42]
No. I would say Fabio Carvalho from Liverpool to Brantford is one to keep an eye on because he's quite low priced. And we probably have a couple of Manchester United boys coming in in the lirt and Mazraoui especially more than de lirt. I think Mazraoui has an attacking fullback. Depending on his price, if the transfer goes through and everything, I think Mazraoui could be, again, quite interesting if you're looking for. If the price is right and you're looking for somebody who we'll keep a few clean sheets there and there. But more importantly, attacking wise, is one of those defenders, one of those fullbacks. I think Mazraou could be good. So at the moment, that's the three that I wrote down. 

Kelly Somers [00:33:20]
How aware are you, Sam, um, of signings that happen this week? And it can. The Solanke one's a prime example, isn't it, of how it can actually completely throw our whole teams. And in a way, thank goodness that Prosecoglu and Spurs got that signing done last week rather than even after the deadline or after game week one. Because we'd have had to restructure things around a little bit. 

Sam Bonfield [00:33:41]
Yeah. And we saw this last season, right, and some managers will make signings in the final week and then they won't start in the first game week and that's fine. But poster Koglio and Spurs don't tend to do that. I mean, we signed Mickey van de Ven like three days before the start of the season last year and he still got the start in that one. So I think you have to be a little bit mindful of that. But it's not just about the player that comes in. It's also about the players that potentially either lose out and don't start who have been playing in pre season or the ones that shift position and end up playing somewhere different. So it's just making sure that you keep a really, really close eye, um, on what's happening ahead of game week one and then making sure that your team is reactive to that because you can't do anything about it. Once game week one hits, you're just going to have to use your transfers to make those changes. But it's worth looking at who might come in. And even if it happens after the deadline, who might it be that's going to change the way that your team is and then trying as best as you can to maybe plan for that. 

Kelly Somers [00:34:39]
Okay, so keep an eye out. It could. There could be another Solanki on the horizon to throw up our whole entire teams. That'll be fun, won't it? Okay, um, I think I said last week, but differential of the week has been so successful and so entertaining for those of us that get to watch on as Sam and Jules do battle, that we are going to do it again. A reminder, a differential are players that are owned by under 10% of the game. Who won last season? Guys? 

Sam Bonfield [00:35:02]
Me. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:03]
Sam's putting her hand up. Yes. Sam m won it. Jules. 

Sam Bonfield [00:35:06]
Yes. You beat me overall, but I won the differentials. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:09]
Okay, Jules, I think it's time to. 

Julien Laurens [00:35:11]
I know which one would rather win. Yeah, for sure, for sure. I've got a great one to start with. Not a surprise, really, but I wasn't. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:20]
Going to let you go first because Sam actually won. But you've already jottered. Uh. Come on. 

Julien Laurens [00:35:26]
What? 7.7% ownership. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:29]
Sam. Um, hold on a sec. Sam is the one that kind of writes the basis of our script here. Differentials at this stage of the season. 

Julien Laurens [00:35:35]
I've got another one for you. Then I've got another one for you. 

Sam Bonfield [00:35:37]
Well, to be fair though, kel, I did have jota as one of my options, so I'm not going to go too heavy on him for this because I also had a similar thought. 

Julien Laurens [00:35:47]
I've got a better one. I've got a better one. I've got a better one. I'm, um, going to give you because you're not happy with my djoko jota. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:54]
Hold on. You never come with two either. This is amazing. Turned over a new lease. 

Sam Bonfield [00:35:57]
Turned over a new lease. 

Julien Laurens [00:36:00]
It's all about planning, talent and vision. If you want to finish top 4000 in the world, you know what you have to do. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:08]
Just tell us your differential. 

Julien Laurens [00:36:09]
Janko Baminte at Brighton. Incredible preseason. Very good. Last season at Fennord on loan from Newcastle. Good signing from Brighton. 5.5 million, which is really, really cheap. The game for midfielder owned by 1.3% of the managers so far. And Everton away. Okay. Not the easiest of fixture, I give you that. For Brighton and the new coach and the new team in a way. But I just think that he's been electric so far in pre season. He was in the last friendly against Villarreal where he scored again. He's got an iconic celebration. So I hope we get to see the celebration this weekend. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:45]
Okay, I like that one. That one was better. But Diogo. Jota. Yeah. That feels like the kind of differential that Sam would pick, that you would shout out. 

Julien Laurens [00:36:51]
No, I mean, she. She picked habits like four times last season somehow. And you let her. 

Sam Bonfield [00:36:57]
Wow. Wow. Come on. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:59]
I've just. I've laid out my stool there. I've set my stool out. I'm being stricter this season. I want proper differentials. And you gave us one there, Jules. So, uh. Well done, Sam. Come on. Then the, uh, the title. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:10]
Till I picked jotter. Then just to annoy him. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:12]
No, I won't allow that. The teacher says no defense of your time. Title, um, starts now. Commences. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:19]
It starts here. Yes. It starts with Jared Bowen as the first one of the season. 

Julien Laurens [00:37:23]
And I think nothing to Bowen. Nothing for. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:26]
I'm making a face. Um. Um. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:28]
Well, no, I think Bowen counts. Who's got Bowen in their teams? He's owned by seven. 

Julien Laurens [00:37:32]
Who's got jota? 7% of like 9 million players. Nobody has. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:35]
Yeah, but, Jules, by the time game week one starts, Jota is going to be owned by a lot more than 10% right now. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:41]
Okay, we should have. Okay, I didn't do this in advance, but maybe we should have said this week that it's players that they can't have had a brilliant season last year because Bowen wasn't a differential last year. He was one of the main players. No, Sam, hold on. Also, I think we might have exposed the one week where Sam's only come with one player. 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:00]
No, I've got three. So I had Jota, uh, who I knew Jules would pick. So I was like, well, I'll pick another couple. So then I picked Bowen because I think he'll be brilliant. And then my other one is Smith, Rowe. So I can go Smith. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:14]
I'll tell you what let's do for this week. I'm just gonna. Sorry, just going to rewrite the rules. We both allowed two differentials. So you can have Jota and Bowen as your first differentials. I'm saying, like, it's not proper differentials. They're not 10%. 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:26]
That's. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:26]
And then I want a deep dive differential though. Go on. See? Deep dive differential with Smith row. Yeah. Okay, but you've got two. You can have Bowen as your first one. Like Jules has got Jota as his first one. 

Julien Laurens [00:38:36]
Okay, so Bowen and Smith Row against Jotin and Minte. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:40]
Yeah. I don't know what this is going to do for the scoring system. It's probably completely screwed it up and being fair because both of you went for differentials that are technically differentials, but in terms of the wider pitch, they don't really feel like differentials. 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:53]
The Smith row is actually owned by more of the game than Bowen is. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:57]
That's mad, isn't it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:59]
Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:38:59]
He's still less than 10%. He has to be less than 10%. 

Sam Bonfield [00:39:01]
So yeah, his is 9.7. 

Julien Laurens [00:39:04]
That's more. That's more than Jordan. 

Sam Bonfield [00:39:06]
Smith row is owned by Jota. He's owned by more than Jared Bowen. He's owned by more than week one. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:11]
And differential of the week is in disarray. This is because you've changed the rules? Well, no, but I feel like by both of us hammering jotter, we've kind of, uh, set ourselves up here a bit. 

Sam Bonfield [00:39:22]
Sam. Um, I didn't hammer jotter. I've got him as one of my options as well. But I'll go with Smith row. It's fine. Um, so like I said earlier, he got just three starts last season. Um, he only played 413 minutes for Arsenal, but he's already done 126 for Fulham in preseason and scored two goals for them. Um, like I said, when he was playing for Arsenal, he got two assists and he was averaging five points per start. Now you have to kind of take that with a little bit of a pinch of salt because he did only start in the three games. But when he does start, he does tend to get some attacking returns in that one. And I think if you look at what's happened in preseason, he's come in, he's already made quite an impact on that Fulham team and I would expect that that would continue. And they've got really nice fixtures going into this early part of the season. So I think he's a differential that works for game week one. But when you are picking a diff for game week one, you do want them to kind of be decent for the few weeks that follow as well. So I think he's one that you could hold relatively long term too. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:18]
Okay, good luck working on the scoring for that, to be honest, because that's. 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:21]
My job, so that'll be. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:22]
I know, I know. That's why I was thinking not only have I killed your differential, I've also killed the scoring as well. But just in the interest of fairness, um, you can both have two this week. A differential and a differential. Ah, captaincy then. Are we all going to be going Harlem? Because that's not the easiest fixture. But when you spend 15 million on a player, sounds hard not to capture him, doesn't it, Jules? 

Julien Laurens [00:40:43]
Yeah, he does. Although I'm really tempted by Jogo Jota against Ipswich away from Liverpool because of the form, because like we said, I think Liverpool are ready. They really are. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:53]
And because he's differential and because. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:56]
Yeah, true. Because I think a lot of people are going to go for Highland captain as well. So, um, I don't know, Isak at home to Southampton or Gordon, if you have Gordon as your, as your Newcastle player is also very tempting. So for now is on Jota, but he might change to Haaland or maybe even Isaac. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:15]
Yeah, some nice options this week, isn't there, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:41:18]
Yeah, mine's on Isak at the moment, but it could yet move to Haaland because, you know, it's Harlem. Um, I also really love the idea of waiting till Monday night for a captain. And like, actually, if you've got a son, his record on a Monday evening fixture is ridiculous, by the way, so you could. You could look at him on Monday evening if you want to go there. But I think for me, if I had Salah, he'd be in the conversation. But we all know I hate captaining someone in the 1230. I just don't enjoy it. And Liverpool don't tend to travel well on a 1230 kickoff either, historically. But it is under a new manager and maybe times have changed. I think I'll end up captain in Isak. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:56]
Um, son's an interesting one, actually. I can't believe we've got the end of the podcast without mentioning him. He's someone else that's probably going to be a victim in terms of ownership. Sam, of that Solanke signing, isn't he? Because before Solanki signed, he was a really nice option too, and he was. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:09]
Steadily growing in ownership, so he was kind of at this eight when preseason started, where all of the other premium options were in by like 30% of the game, and he was at 8%. And I was like, what is happening? And then as preseason has gone on, his ownership has steadily increased. And then it's taken a little bit of a hit since the Solanki move because people are thinking, well, why do I need to spend ten when I could spend a seven and a half on the spurs forward? And it's all of that kind of internal negotiation that you do with yourself. That's how much do I need to spend on each club. And I think Solanke will harm son's ownership. So if you do have him, he is going to be, although not officially a differential because I think at the moment he's about 11% owned. He will be a relatively good differential. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:53]
If he was a differential, you'd have 100% picked him. Oh, total differential of the week. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:57]
And then you'd have signed off for. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:58]
That as well, for sure. We did two types of differentials this week, guys. Come on. Okay, so this is something that isn't in our plan, and we do have to wrap up the podcast right now, but we. This is one of the first seasons in a wild. Samuel, we haven't done any predictions, and I just think it's quite nice to do it. So let's just predict who we think is going to be the highest scoring FPL player of the season. Jules, who do you think it's going to be? 

Julien Laurens [00:43:21]
I, uh, would go put you on the spot here. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:23]
Sorry. 

Julien Laurens [00:43:24]
Yeah, it's a bit basically, Sam M. 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:26]
Uh, I do think it will be harlanous. Boringly. I think he'll have a really good season this year. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:31]
I do. Some are off. 

Julien Laurens [00:43:33]
I know, but I don't want to say Howland. Yeah. You know, I told you last week he went fishing. Salmon and stuff, uh, cutting trees. I, uh. Okay. Highlands. 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:44]
Highlands. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:45]
Well, that was a nice boring night to end on, wasn't it? 

Julien Laurens [00:43:48]
Sorry. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:48]
And who's going to finish top out of us three? I'm gonna. I'm gonna back Sam to retake top last season. 

Julien Laurens [00:43:55]
I can't remember. Some stupid friend talent, vision and planning. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:01]
I'm gonna go for a, uh, I'm gonna go for a Sam Jules Kelly finish. I'm really backing myself. Jules. You're gonna go for Jules Sam Kelly? Probably, yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:44:11]
Yeah. I need to win this again to show that last season was not fluke. And then. And then Sam, at some point can't be as bad as she was. Last season for most of it. So she finished second. And you, Kelly, because you do all your transfers, like, five minutes before deadline every time. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:26]
I just love a panic, don't I? 

Julien Laurens [00:44:27]
But all three of us will be in the top 50,000 in the world. Uh, this is my bold prediction. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:33]
That's my target as well, actually. To come top 50,000, all three of us would be top 50,000. Yeah, I was kind of at points floating towards it, but points floating outside the top 100, so. Yeah. Sam, where do you think we're all going to finish? And what do you want to finish overall? What's your target, Kells? 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:47]
Our teams are going to end up being quite similar again. So if I have a good season, you'll have a good season. That's how I feel. 

Julien Laurens [00:44:52]
She could be on you all the time. That's why. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:54]
Yeah, but I beat her last season, so why would I copy her? 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:57]
Exactly. We just think the same way, Kelly. That's all it is. 

Julien Laurens [00:44:59]
Okay? Okay. Um. 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:01]
I mean, I've got to have a better season. I can't do this again. I can't be me again. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:06]
Maybe you should start copying me. Shall I? 

Julien Laurens [00:45:11]
That's a great start of this year. 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:13]
Kelly, it's impossible for someone to copy you because you make your transfers two minutes before the deadline, so nobody can copy what you're doing. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:19]
I'm making some ridiculous faces on this YouTube thing now. I've just forgotten that we're actually on YouTube, and I'm, like, making all these, like, pointing at you. I need to start. In fact, I'm going to end the podcast here before I embarrass myself. So, Sam, you think. Are you going to. Are you backing yourself to finish on top out of the three of us? 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:32]
Yeah, surely. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:34]
And then me bottom. 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:35]
No. I'll, ah, back you to finish above Jules this year, Kels. Yes. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:39]
Um, and what's your target? 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:41]
It's always top ten k. And I need a good season after last year. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:45]
Okay, very best of luck with it, guys. This is it. This is where we begin. Then, um, how locked would you say your drafts are, percentage wise? Jules? Jules is playing basketball again, for those of you not tuning in on YouTube. 

Julien Laurens [00:45:56]
No. No. This should be it. This should be it. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:58]
Now should be it. 

Julien Laurens [00:45:59]
Yeah. This is very strong. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:01]
I'm indefinite, decisive. You're more indecisive than me the amount of times you go. I'm going to captain Sally. 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:06]
Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:46:06]
On captain Sea. But there will be no changes now to the team between now and Friday. 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:11]
No changes? 

Julien Laurens [00:46:12]
No. Why would I change unless somebody gets injured at uh, training. But otherwise this. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:18]
I'm going to check your team and check guys. 

Julien Laurens [00:46:21]
I'll send it to you, Sam. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:22]
How locked? 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:23]
50 50 I reckon I am. Oh, she's locked. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:28]
Well, you know, I'm gonna do you a favor and I'm gonna let you go and finish that team then because it sounds like you've got a lot of words to do. I've got a lot of time to do this week. Uh, Jules has got 47,000 other podcasts to be on so we'll let you go 1 minute. So uh, don't forget your FPL team. The deadline, oh, he literally has got a minute so I'll let you go. The pod mini lead code. A reminder is q seven yco zero. That's an o is in the letter. Your deadline, your first one of the season. If you're going to miss one, guys, don't let it be this one. Friday night, 630. Uh, because the Premier league does get underway on Friday night. So get those teams set. The very best of luck. I know it is stressful these last few days, but it will be worth it. All aboard. The FPL roller coaster is about to begin.
