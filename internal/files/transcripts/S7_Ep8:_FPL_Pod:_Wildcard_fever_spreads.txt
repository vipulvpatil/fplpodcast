Kelly Somers [00:00:01]
Sound the alarm. The Premier League is back and we have a wild card active. Jules runs us through his new look team. We run the rule over Arsenal and the usual arguments ensue and I almost lose my patience. Well, hello. Welcome to the FPL pod, and it's a bit of a special one today for those of you listening as a podcast. As I always say, when we do these in person, it makes probably absolutely no difference. But if you are watching us on YouTube. Hello. Yes, we are in person. Which camera should we wave? Cameras. We don't know where to wave. Hello. Yes, we are all together in a studio in London. Sam Bondfield, Julian Laurent and Kelly Summers with you as always, guys. Nice to see you. Nice to be back with you. First time this season? 

Sam Bonfield [00:00:46]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:00:46]
It's an international break, so we thought we've got a little bit more time, so let's get together. Uh, let's chat FPL and dun dun dun. Let's chat wild cards. It is active, isn't it? 

Julien Laurens [00:00:57]
Yeah. I didn't think I would play it. I said last week it's an international break. I know, but then I only ever. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:03]
Do it in that week. Why do people go early? 

Julien Laurens [00:01:05]
Because this year now with the new rules and the fact that you can roll on your transfer up to five, then that's why I explained last week, it makes a big difference because you can play your wild card now and even after that, make quite a lot of changes by the time you get to the next international break. So I think actually it makes more sense to do it now, your wild card, than next month for the next international break. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:26]
The world cast comes with a disclaimer. Everything Julian said, it's a lie. It'll be disregarded within a couple of weeks. 

Julien Laurens [00:01:31]
It convinced me more than anything else last week. So I thought, I. I thought, yeah, uh, let's go. Let's go for it. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:35]
Jules, what was the tipping point? What was the reason? There must have been a moment where something happened. 

Julien Laurens [00:01:39]
Yeah. And it's two words, very easy, Mohamed Salah. And it's just as simple as that. Uh, I thought I watched him play for Egypt and he was great again. And I was like, really? I can't go into game week four seriously without him in the team. And remember, we discussed it during the preseason and then at the start of the season and we all had drafts with Haaland and Salah, and I was just not brave enough. I didn't like the teams enough, uh, to do it. And now I just thought it's a must have really? When you see how much informed me how great Liverpool have been so far, that if you can make it happen and get Salah in your team on top of Haaland without using your wild card, good for you. I just could not do it, so I had to also play the wild card for that. 

Kelly Somers [00:02:21]
Sam, I feel like I need to say something to you at this point, otherwise we're going to spend the first 15 minutes of this podcast just talking about George's wild card, because I've got so many questions, as I imagine you have as well. 

Sam Bonfield [00:02:29]
Yeah, multiple questions. I don't know. Look, I think it does make sense. It's one of the highest wild card weeks ever in FPL. So a lot of managers feeling like tools is, and I think for most managers it is, that if you started the season without Salah, if you started the season without Harlan, there's that fear factor. I've definitely still got that fear factor. 

Julien Laurens [00:02:50]
Play your one card. 

Sam Bonfield [00:02:51]
Come on. No, not yet. No. I think for me, like, if I was going to do it, I'd have done it at the beginning of the international break, like doing it now with a few days to go till the deadline. 

Kelly Somers [00:02:59]
What day did you press the button? 

Julien Laurens [00:03:01]
Friday, I think. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:02]
So how did you literally just right after the bus. 

Julien Laurens [00:03:05]
I'd think about it already before. And then I thought, no, you weren't, because also the price would have gone up by Saturday. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:11]
No, the prices are interesting, actually. 

Julien Laurens [00:03:13]
Yeah, it's all about talent, you know, planning, talent and vision. 

Sam Bonfield [00:03:16]
Is that what it is? It's actually got notes in it as well. 

Julien Laurens [00:03:22]
Look at this. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:23]
That's more notes than you've ever made. 

Sam Bonfield [00:03:25]
I actually like the fact that he's got a dedicated notebook for FPL as well. 

Julien Laurens [00:03:28]
Now, game week three. This is. I can't fail. This week. I cannot fail. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:34]
Okay, um, so there is a lot of wild cards that are currently being played. In fact, as it stands, we're recording this on Wednesday morning. This is, of course, the second podcast, this international break. You can still go back and listen to the one last Thursday. Just ignore everything that Jules said. But there will still be some stuff in there that's relevant. But at the point of recording, there are 600. Why do I always struggle to read numbers out loud? I've always had things, and now we don't cut things out of podcasts. Even more evident. 627,873 wild cards active. What time was that? Ah, as of Sam, because it'll probably have already changed by now. 

Sam Bonfield [00:04:09]
Well, it will have done. That was about half ten okay. 

Kelly Somers [00:04:12]
And this is 1116 live. 

Julien Laurens [00:04:14]
That's a lot. 

Kelly Somers [00:04:15]
Um, so yeah, it will be changing. It will be going up. Uh, this triple captain's being activated. 150 odd thousand free hits as well. Almost 90,000 and almost 60,000 bench boosts. But wild cards, that's bonkers. Bonkers. There's nearly 500,000 more active than there were at the time of recording last week. So, yeah, it's going up really, really quickly. Before we get into your wild card team, I'm just going to all remind you of the FPL pod minileague code because I often forget to do that as well. The code is Q seven yco, uh, zero. Thank you to everyone that's joined us in that. Uh, if you want to listen to the current standings again, go back and listen to our last podcast. But come on, Jules, let's just get underway because everyone is screaming at their smartphone. Jules, who's in your wildcard team? 

Julien Laurens [00:04:56]
So I can't really remember all the good advice that you gave last week on people wanting to play your wild card. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:01]
I've just told everyone else to listen back. You should maybe do this team from. 

Sam Bonfield [00:05:04]
Last week and see how many changes. 

Julien Laurens [00:05:05]
Okay, okay, listen. So the idea was all about Mo Salah, as we've said. But for that I had to sacrifice bukayo saka. Unfortunately, yeah, because you can't have Haaland saka. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:15]
Do you have no arsenal attacker? 

Julien Laurens [00:05:17]
So then I moved in kind Havertz. Yeah. And I think this is fair. You get Arsenal's attack covered. 

Sam Bonfield [00:05:23]
Um, it's pretty much the team I said last week. It's. 

Julien Laurens [00:05:25]
No, don't say that, Harry. Wings, who are roasted earlier on in the season for wild. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:30]
No, you've not brought him in. 

Julien Laurens [00:05:31]
It is just like to stand on my bench. 

Sam Bonfield [00:05:34]
You're not allowed to have Harry. 

Julien Laurens [00:05:34]
He's not even on my bench. I think he would be with the medical staff, the role behind the bench. But anyway, you know, I'll have him there. So the dilemma I have right now. So Anthony Robinson has come in, uh, because as we said, the Fulham schedule looks good, the fixtures. He's been great. Even in a poor USA team in this national break. He played well, I thought. So he's in. But then I've kept Saliba, I've kept Konsa and Pedro Poro. Uh, so Mo Salah in midfield has come, uh, with Semeno because I think, as we mentioned last week, he's on good form. He's quite cheap at 5.6 million. It makes sense. And then for my last spot. So Winks and Rodgers, aka nine, who was great with England under 21 in this nine. 

Kelly Somers [00:06:17]
Is he gonna get some points eventually, though? 

Julien Laurens [00:06:19]
Eventually, surely. Is he too good for Karo Mitoma? Is my last dilemma in there. No, because I didn't have enough money, so. But I can tell you this is my dilemma now. So my front three is a stellar front three because I kept Isak and I changed Solanki. Havitz for Solanki. Right. So that means I've got Haaland, Isak and Havitz. I can downgrade Isak for a Joel Pedro, for example, or Johan Wisa, which then gives me more money to upgrade somebody in midfield for a mbumo, for example. But if I get Isak to Joel Pedro, I can even get an Anthony Gordon. I can probably get to Kevin de Bruyne if I want. So it gives me so much more money if I go from Isak to Joao Pedro, for example. 

Sam Bonfield [00:07:05]
But you're not doing that. 

Julien Laurens [00:07:06]
It's very tempting. But I just like Isaac. He scored in game week three. He played really well with Sweden, scored two goals in one of their two games. Looked really, really sharp. And they've got wolves away. And then the next game is at home against Fulham before they play City. So I'm kind of. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:22]
You could do that in a couple of weeks. 

Sam Bonfield [00:07:24]
Yeah, you could wait because Rememo has got Man City and then spurts. 

Julien Laurens [00:07:27]
Exactly. So Bradford has tough games. So that's why I'm thinking I'm going to keep an amazing front three, really, of Haaland, Isak and Harvard for now. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:35]
I really like that front three. Run through it then from goalkeepers defence all the way through to forwards. 

Julien Laurens [00:07:39]
So my boy Areola in goal with Flecken. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:41]
There's no change there. 

Julien Laurens [00:07:42]
There's no change. I can't let go of a 0.5 there. 

Sam Bonfield [00:07:46]
Uh, by going for a. By losing Areola. I know he's born and bred. 

Julien Laurens [00:07:51]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:52]
You'd be such a better FPL player if you let go of that Paris. 

Julien Laurens [00:07:55]
No, I can't. 

Sam Bonfield [00:07:55]
You forgot your parents. 

Julien Laurens [00:07:58]
That speaks Pedro Poro, Robinson, Konsa, uh, Faez and Saliba, Sala, Mitoma, Semeno Rogers, aka nine reals and Winx. And then Haaland, Isaac and Havretz. Get in. Come on, people. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:12]
Firstly, it's very similar to the thing we discussed last week. 

Sam Bonfield [00:08:15]
Very similar. 

Julien Laurens [00:08:17]
You know, you mentioned Mbomo, you gave other names. Goalkeeper change, you said. 

Sam Bonfield [00:08:22]
Um, yeah, but I said I'd go fleck in. Who you already have yeah, but I. 

Julien Laurens [00:08:27]
Realize, my boy, I can't do that. You know, the one I'm tempted to make it work is Ferdy at, uh, Brighton, the turkish left back who we saw being so good at the Euros dev sign, who didn't go away with Turkey in his national break to stay at Brighton and everything. And I think he will hit the ground running straight away. I would expect him to start at home against Ipswich because that's a good game for him to start at left back. Um, and at 4.5 million, I think Ferdy could be a really smart signing right now. So this is the other one with MBO mode. I'm like, okay, I'll be tempted. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:59]
Is there anything missing from that team for you, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:09:03]
Annoyingly, it's quite good, isn't it? Um, I don't know. I would be tempted to just have one goalkeeper. But you're not. 

Kelly Somers [00:09:12]
Is there not an element of you that doesn't want the headache each week? Yeah, because I always find when I have rotating goalkeepers I always pick the wrong one to play. 

Julien Laurens [00:09:18]
But then Flecken has city, for example, and Aria has Fulham, so. 

Sam Bonfield [00:09:22]
Yeah, but the. 

Kelly Somers [00:09:23]
I get that. 

Sam Bonfield [00:09:24]
But equally like, if you have a 4.0, that's an extra 0.5. Have you got any money in the bank? Not 0.1. Yeah, but he's not gonna get you very. No, but I think having that extra 0.5 off of a goalkeeper would like. In reality, from game week seven onwards, you're gonna play flecken every single week. Like, there's not gonna be a week where you play Areola in all of that time. It's just, it's just a waste of money sitting on your bench. And if you said to me, oh, I'm gonna play my bench boosting game week seven, then I'd be like, well, fair enough, because then it gives you a playing goalkeeper. But in reality, are you gonna do that or are you gonna wait until the new year to do it? 

Julien Laurens [00:09:57]
So who do I get as a 4 million? 

Sam Bonfield [00:09:59]
Well, anybody. It doesn't, it doesn't really matter. 

Julien Laurens [00:10:01]
Some I don't even know their names, some don't exist. 

Sam Bonfield [00:10:04]
And then you just go for the substitute Brentford goalkeeper. But don't make me say his name because I don't know how to. 

Julien Laurens [00:10:09]
I'm gonna go, I think for somebody really good, uh, Joel Laemley at Southampton. 

Sam Bonfield [00:10:13]
Just because you can say that. 

Julien Laurens [00:10:14]
It's a funny name and. 

Sam Bonfield [00:10:16]
Yeah, but I think so. But at that point then if you wanted to, then you've got a like you maybe don't have to downgrade Isak. If he starts performing well you can maybe get to uh, embommo by just moving some of the budget around elsewhere. 

Julien Laurens [00:10:29]
Yeah, and mitomah, mitomah is the one that uh, obviously last season was not his best season, as we know and he got an injury halfway through it, to be fair. But if I think he gets back to the mitomah from the season before that who was outstanding. And again, Brighton have ipswich at home. We mentioned then they've got forest at home. So back to back home game then Chelsea. Uh, but Mitoma played really well with Japan, scored uh, and assisted in both games, came back their game was early enough on Tuesday to have come back in good time to play on Saturday. I would expect so. And he looked really good like all that frontline well back Joe Pedro, even the minte. M yeah, same thing as well if. 

Sam Bonfield [00:11:06]
He went for Minte hippo. But mitoma is better. 

Julien Laurens [00:11:09]
Mitoma is still better than Minte. So. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:12]
M also if you've got mitoma, I don't think you need to worry about. I know you're not worried about having Joel Pedro. The reason you'd want Pedro is to cover Isak. You've got some Brighton attack. 

Sam Bonfield [00:11:19]
But then if you had Joel Pedro instead of Isak you probably wouldn't want. 

Julien Laurens [00:11:24]
So Brighton would be covered with Joao Pedro and then from Mitoma with m the extra money from the IsAG to Joao Pedro transfer, I can get to almost KDB, I think. So that's the dilemma and that's the thing that can change between now and Saturday, really. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:38]
No Chelsea either in there, is there? 

Julien Laurens [00:11:40]
So Nico Williams, sorry, Nico Williams. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:43]
We can't cut things out. 

Julien Laurens [00:11:47]
So Nico Jackson is the other one. But obviously the difference is still more expensive, much more expensive than Joel Pedro. So that doesn't give me actually that much money to upgrade a mitoma or semeno or somebody like that. But yeah, Nico Jackson is another really strong possibility because as we said, Chelsea fixtures are really good going forward. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:06]
M and of course you couldn't even consider, if you weren't going to consider Pokay Osaka, you couldn't consider Karl Palmer. 

Julien Laurens [00:12:11]
Yeah, that's too expensive. But I would. But again, Haaland Salah and I Palma takes so much money. If you want to keep a saliba, for example, I think it's too, it's too difficult. Too much. 

Sam Bonfield [00:12:23]
Okay, I need some defense there either. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:24]
No, yeah, good point. 

Julien Laurens [00:12:26]
The only one could be Robertson for Saliba. The Saliba. I can't like he would literally. 

Sam Bonfield [00:12:30]
Pedro Perot to Robertson now, though, just, you know. 

Julien Laurens [00:12:35]
Yeah, that's possibility. I didn't think about that. Yeah. No, I didn't think about that. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:39]
I would do that. 

Julien Laurens [00:12:40]
But Pedro Poro is going to return against Arsenal. I feel it. 

Sam Bonfield [00:12:43]
Oh, I hope so. 

Julien Laurens [00:12:44]
I know you do. I feel it. So we see there's still a few things that could change between now and Saturday. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:49]
Okay, this is the FPL pod, not the Julian Laurent wild card pod. So let's move on now. Thank you for revealing that, Jules. Um, myself and Sam are a bit envious, actually, I think. Yeah. 

Sam Bonfield [00:12:59]
Only really of the Salah pick, though. 

Kelly Somers [00:13:01]
No, there's a lot. I'm quite envious. M who else? 

Julien Laurens [00:13:03]
Salah home to Forest is not in your team right now. I love your team. 

Kelly Somers [00:13:06]
I would like to sort out my defence. 

Sam Bonfield [00:13:09]
I'm convinced that Joss is going to start because Darwin hasn't been away on international duty. 

Julien Laurens [00:13:13]
True. He was not involved with Uruguay, so. 

Sam Bonfield [00:13:14]
I am, like, slightly worried about that. 

Julien Laurens [00:13:17]
Nah, Jotin will play well, he'll play. 

Sam Bonfield [00:13:19]
But if Darwin gets the start, I. 

Julien Laurens [00:13:22]
Don'T want you to get Salah to be for you two because then that means if he does well, then you're going to benefit. 

Kelly Somers [00:13:28]
Ok. You mentioned the international break and the fact that Darwin hasn't been away. Um, we have, of course, seen lots of players in action. Lots of players will be travelling back. Lots of players probably still haven't even played at this point. So it does make the weekend very interesting and will undoubtedly have an impact on our FPL teams this weekend. What have you noticed from the international break that we need to consider going into this next round of fixtures and getting week four, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:13:50]
I mean, I think we always have to look at how far they've gone when they're back. Like Jules mentioned, like, Matona's obviously been away with Japan, but was back early enough. And actually, really, it's only the Brazil match that was super late. That happened, like, early hours of Wednesday morning. So they're the only team, really, that you have to be overly cautious of because even when you look at Argentina and Colombia, they were on Tuesday, so. 

Julien Laurens [00:14:12]
They were nearly kickoffs. 

Sam Bonfield [00:14:13]
It's actually not so bad. Um, but also the teams that we used to worry about that with, particularly was Liverpool. And of course, we don't really know whether it's still going to be the same under slot as it was with Klopp. So with Klopp, you're North Americans, never really started the game that followed, but with slot will that be the same? It's really difficult to know. So I think you just need to make sure that the bench is as good as it can be heading into the next week. And that's going to be hard because if you've got Barco and people like that still there, it is a challenge. Well, I'm the same and I am looking at. 

Julien Laurens [00:14:46]
I don't have him anymore. I don't know what I do. 

Sam Bonfield [00:14:49]
And so Barco, I think, like, could, could actually start to be an issue for people at this point. It could start to be an issue. 

Julien Laurens [00:14:58]
But that's a different game. 

Sam Bonfield [00:15:00]
It could start to be an issue at this point because you are looking at your team now. Look, if Jostler doesn't get the start because Darwin's banned and therefore hasn't gone on international duty, and maybe slot goes well, you've not been away. I give you the star. I can't imagine that Jota doesn't come on at all for Liverpool in that game and hopefully comes on against a tired forest defence and it's all right. Um, but, yeah, and I think, you know, you've got other players at Liverpool. Like, for me, I get it. Like, I want Salah. 

Julien Laurens [00:15:26]
I think that Salah is overrated. 

Sam Bonfield [00:15:27]
But you look at the two performances that Trent put in for England over international break and I'm like, all right, well, I can't have Salah, but I can have Trent. And you've not got Trent. That's true, I think. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:39]
Have you done that transferred? 

Sam Bonfield [00:15:41]
No, not yet, but it will happen. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:44]
What are you waiting for? 

Sam Bonfield [00:15:45]
Well, nobody was just laughing. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:47]
You told us last week you were going to make it. 

Sam Bonfield [00:15:49]
We were still going to do it, but I was waiting on price rises and they haven't come. But he hasn't risen. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:53]
So you were waiting for him to rise? 

Sam Bonfield [00:15:54]
No, waiting until it was going to happen. Because I wanted to get through the international fixtures, ideally because if somebody. 

Kelly Somers [00:16:02]
Got injured. 

Sam Bonfield [00:16:04]
Yeah. Or if, like, if I'd have had Erdogard, for example, and then you might have to deal with that. I wanted to wait until the international fixtures were done, but I would have done it earlier. If Trent was rising and vardial was falling, I would have done it over the last week. But because that's not happened, I was like, well, I just wait that out and I'll do it. So I'll probably do it tonight or tomorrow night, now that I know that everybody's fine. And obviously Trent survived and got through that, because worst case scenario, I was thinking, if I'd have done it had to go early. Then I'd have wild card if I didn't really want a wild card just because I brought in a player who got injured. 

Kelly Somers [00:16:37]
Yeah, ok. Yeah, we've all been there. I think, um, in terms of transfers, then the, uh, markets have been busy, as they often are during international breaks, and it will only get busier as we gear up for the return of FPL. Joel Pedro and Luis Diaz are the most popular transfers in ahead of game week four. Both of them have been on international duty, though with south american teams, as we've been mentioning, that can be a little bit of a problem, especially as Liverpool and Brighton both play at 03:00 on Saturday. Brazil's last match was at 130 in the morning on Wednesday. Colombia's last match was at 930 on Tuesday evening. In terms of transfers out, Isak is still being shipped out in his droves. He leads the way. Then it's Watkins, Saka and Guardiol. That is perhaps a reflection, though, Jules, on people needing money for salad. Do you think, like yourself? 

Julien Laurens [00:17:21]
Yeah, absolutely. I think again, um, the saka move to Salah, there's what, two point something million in it. So you could probably make it work with two free transfer, three free transfers if you, if you find the right combination for it, really, uh, and simply because Saka also has spurs away and city away in his next twos game, which of course, Arsenal can still win those two games. Saka can shine, of course he can, but they can also draw two games nil nil, and there's no return for Saka or lose both games. And Saka doesn't do anything. So I can see why you can let Saka go and then maybe try to bring him back after those two really, really tough fixtures. And for Isaac, that's the one I find a little bit more surprising. Unless again is Isak to Joel Pedro to free some money for Isaka, Tus Salah, for example, which is probably the most likely scenario. But Isak scoring in game week three, as we mentioned, looking good, looking really good with Sweden, albeit in games that are quite easy for a player like him. Still, scoring is always good, even on international duty. So I would be surprised, I'm a bit surprised that Isak is the most transferred out compared to Watkins, for example, who didn't go with England because he was not fully fit, hasn't started well, has missed M big chances right now. Uh, I would trust Isak to do better than Watkins coming into game week four, for example. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:36]
Yeah, he did get the assist in game week three. It was pretty fast. 

Julien Laurens [00:18:40]
Yeah, don't mention it. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:41]
I was hoping to skirt over it. 

Julien Laurens [00:18:43]
Did I tell you about Liv Davis assist? 

Kelly Somers [00:18:45]
Oh, stun. Let's not go there again. 

Julien Laurens [00:18:47]
Sorry. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:48]
But he's got Everton next up. So we all agree, hold Isak because of the fixtures and maybe review it in a couple of weeks time and see if he picks up. He's had a good international break. As we mentioned there, Watkins second most sold. But maybe managers are running out of patience because of those lack of goals. But he faces Everton next. They've conceded ten goals in the opening three matches of the season. They're the only team in the league to have conceded double digits so far. It's brave to sell him ahead of that, isn't it still, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:19:14]
It is, it is. Yeah, but people are doing it because they want Salah. Like you only have to look at the combinations of transfers that tells you that actually people are only sacrificing the likes of BSAC and Watkins because they want to have Salah or they want to have Haaland, depending upon which one they went without at the start of the season. But I think it is very brave. I mean, Everton defensively are all over the place and whilst Watkins hasn't started the season well, I think you need to look at that fixture and go, well, if there's ever a time that Watkins is gonna come good, it feels like it's gonna be in this one, doesn't it? So personally for me, I'd hold them both. I get why you've held Isak on wild card. I'd probably do the same. Although do just watch, because he's been so highly transferred out, he might drop in price at some point. So then sell him and then bring him back after the price drop so you don't lose your point. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:01]
One look at his face, that's too much for Jules. That's what don't want to lose a? 

Julien Laurens [00:20:05]
.1 no. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:07]
Jules, write that down in your notebook. 

Sam Bonfield [00:20:08]
Yeah, okay, I'll do that, of course. Thank you very much. 

Julien Laurens [00:20:14]
Um, I'm not even sure what to write on my not hard price rise. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:19]
Watch esap price fall in, out, out, in. 

Sam Bonfield [00:20:22]
So he's worth 8.5 to you. If he drops in price, then he'd only be worth 8.4 to you. Whereas if you sell him, you've got 8.5 in your bag. 

Julien Laurens [00:20:30]
Yes. 

Sam Bonfield [00:20:30]
And then like next day. 

Julien Laurens [00:20:33]
I just wanted you to explain it for people unlike me, who don't know. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:37]
Okay? 

Julien Laurens [00:20:38]
Right, yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:38]
Okay, let's move on while Jules writes those important notes down. Is he actually writing it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:20:42]
Well, he's trying to write something. I don't think he really understands what he's writing. 

Julien Laurens [00:20:45]
No, no, no. It's just written in. I like to do those little. 

Sam Bonfield [00:20:48]
I don't quite know what language he's written. 

Julien Laurens [00:20:50]
Price is like, look. And I do a little thing like this to make sure I remember those little brothers. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:55]
Even the YouTube viewers aren't going to be able to see what that says, so let's not show him your notepad. Um, Saka is the next most transferred out player. Perhaps a little bit of a surprise because he's the 6th highest scoring player in the game and someone that I know I need to sell if I want to get Salah in, but I just can't bring myself to a fairly nice. Yeah, that's a large part of the reason, um, Sam wrote in the notes here. Do we think that's a sensible decision? I don't think it's ever a sensible decision to sell Saka, but I do understand it. 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:21]
Yeah, but his record against spurs is obscene. And. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:25]
Go on, just remind me. 

Julien Laurens [00:21:25]
And he's on pens. 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:26]
Last season, 25 points against spurs, more than he got against any other team. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:31]
That's all right. 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:32]
I know I got to sit there and watch it as well. Sunday afternoon, it'll be terrible. Um, but at least I'll have him. So if he does go off, at least I can cry into my, ah. 

Julien Laurens [00:21:43]
But then he's not going to face Ben Davies like he did last season in the Tottenham stadium. This is udogi. This is different. I think even for Saka himself, it's a different challenge. 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:53]
That's true. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:53]
Are you a little bit worried about Arsenal? Obviously we don't know what's happening with Odegaard at the moment. M with the ankle injury, definitely worth keeping an eye, um, on what Arteta says about him, but also no deck can rice? 

Julien Laurens [00:22:03]
Yeah, yeah, I think so. And I think Calafiori should be okay. But I don't know if he would start or not because he hasn't been a starter so far. 

Kelly Somers [00:22:11]
Got him in my draft team. I'd quite appreciate if he could start. I brought him in in the draft because I thought it was a really wise, long term move. Running out of patience. He's not a patient. 

Julien Laurens [00:22:21]
The day will start, he will stay forever and I think he would be great because he goes into midfield, uh, he can get goals and assist easily. So I think the day he comes on for Arsenal and then kind of get that starting position I think we should bring him in because really he would be that good for them. But I just don't know how long it will take for Arteta to finally put him and start him for every game. It could be Sunday, it could be the week after against City. Or more likely, I think you let those two games go and you play players who've been in those fixtures before, nor La Cala Fiore. And then after that it's easier for him, I guess, to settle in and play against the two, really the two toughest away games that Arsenal will have all season. Away as spurs and away as City. It doesn't get tougher than that for them. So I don't think Alafiori would start in either, really. 

Sam Bonfield [00:23:10]
I just think that Arsenal are one of those teams where uh, if you've invested in them, um, it doesn't matter what the fixture is. They are, in FPL terms, fixture proof. 

Kelly Somers [00:23:19]
The same is like with City and Liverpool. 

Sam Bonfield [00:23:20]
The same with City. It's the same as Liverpool. If you spend that level of budget on a player, that's it. 

Kelly Somers [00:23:25]
You're backing them to scoring them and. 

Sam Bonfield [00:23:27]
You back them to score whether they are at home or away, whether they've got the most difficult fixture. Because you're right, they are the most difficult away fixtures. Mostly because of the noise on Sunday and the rivalry that's there. But also I just think that they are the sort of fixtures if you want to be the Premier League champions, you have to go and get something. 

Kelly Somers [00:23:47]
Out of those games. 

Sam Bonfield [00:23:48]
So the motivation will be there. Um, and the underlying stats are there for Saka as well. Like he started the season really, really well and he is a big part of the reason I'm not wild carding because I don't want to lose him. 

Kelly Somers [00:24:00]
Also, I can understand when people look at the next couple of fixtures, but then if you looked beyond then Jules. Yeah, lesser at home after those fixtures, and then people are going to be desperate, these people that are selling them. By the way, Saliba's the 11th most sold. Odegaard's the 15th. We have mentioned that potentially he's got an injury worth keeping tabs on, that one. And Havertz is the 19th. Havertz surprised me a little bit because I thought he would be an obvious one to bring into the attack to cover. But people are going to be looking at that Leicester fixture and all of a sudden going, ah, uh, okay, at. 

Sam Bonfield [00:24:28]
Least you've got two. 

Julien Laurens [00:24:30]
Yeah. The thing I would say with Havertz and obviously I uh, brought him in the team before the Odegaard potential injury is that if Odegaard is out for the game on Sunday, Havertz could be dropped from the number nine position where it's obviously better for us in the game in terms of him being in goal scoring positions to a deeper midfielder role because you will have probably Jorginho party and then you need Havers there. If there's no rice, certainly, and then potentially no other guard and then it's not the same threat from Harvard if he plays in an eight than if he plays as a nine. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:01]
If that happens, who will benefit in terms of Arsenal attackers? 

Julien Laurens [00:25:04]
So then I think there'll be even more emphasis on Saka to go back to the point where because I think especially with harvest, I guess Trossard can play there. Not sure about Gabriel Jesus fitness yet. And then you've got the Ryan Sterling kind of wild card. As in wild card in could he start in a game like this? Is he fit enough to could he play as a force nine? Potentially more m likely as a left winger. And then even for us in the game, I think Sterling, a bit like Sancho at Chelsea, is just a name. Talking about new signings we haven't seen yet in their new team. We mentioned Ferdy before. You can go to Lacroix, Crystal palace and Ktia with palace wall, prowse with forest. Those guys that we haven't seen yet really with their teams because of when the transfer was so late, but that we need to keep an eye on. And what if Sterling was to have a great role somehow, somewhere in the game on Sunday, for example. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:55]
Okay, so sell Arsenal. Uh, but actually don't sell Arsenal. And if you're going to, you just need to be very aware, don't you, Sam, of maybe having a long term plan. 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:05]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:05]
And keeping cover. If you can't get to soccer, is it about keeping cover in some other capacity? 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:09]
I mean, I think if you want to, if you want to be really brave and do the next two weeks because it's spurs and then man city without, then fine. But be aware of the fixture from game week six. And know that when you hit game week six you have to have a plan. Now it might be to do what Jaws is doing and that's to have the transfers. I mean, hopefully you don't get any injuries now. Yeah, uh, and have the transfer. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:31]
Sorry, you're gonna, you're trying to bank all of your transfers. 

Julien Laurens [00:26:34]
It's got this master plan. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:36]
Yeah, it's got this plan. 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:37]
It's all about, you know, talent, vision. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:39]
Yay. 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:40]
But unless you've got got an injury, then that's fine, right, but if you can, then you just need a plan. You need some transfers in the bank. You need to know, come game week six, who am I sacrificing and how am I investing in Arsenal? Because there's absolutely no way that you want to go from game week six onwards without having, uh, arsenal players in. So if you want Saka in and you're wild carding at the moment, work out what the strategy is going to be. Because obviously, for me, if I took him out right now to buy Salah, I could wild card in six. And that's what a lot of people are going to do in six to bring in arsenal assets. I've already got two, so I probably won't. I'll probably just play through it if possible. Um, but I think that is something to be really mindful of, is you just have to have some sort of plan and know how you get in the budget to get them. 

Kelly Somers [00:27:27]
That was a good little arsenal chat, then. You know what time is it is now. We should cut that bit out of the pocket. Do you know what time it is? 

Julien Laurens [00:27:35]
Uh, 1139. 

Sam Bonfield [00:27:38]
It's time to talk about Arsenal. That's what she was talking to. 

Kelly Somers [00:27:41]
No, no, we've done the arsenal. 

Sam Bonfield [00:27:43]
Yeah, too much time. 

Kelly Somers [00:27:43]
Do you know what it's time to. 

Sam Bonfield [00:27:44]
Oh, is it differentials time? 

Kelly Somers [00:27:46]
Thank you. We got there in the end. Okay, for those of you, the radio silence, then, is also because Sam, um, has just put her head in her hands. Sam, do you want to do a little update? 

Sam Bonfield [00:27:56]
Yeah, but he was just moaning before we went on. 

Julien Laurens [00:27:58]
I just would like to appeal. 

Kelly Somers [00:28:00]
Moaning to the decision. 

Julien Laurens [00:28:01]
Yeah, yeah, like I go to VR. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:03]
No, you can't appeal, because at the end of that pod, Kelly specifically said, george, you can only have one. Who do you. 

Julien Laurens [00:28:09]
I remember mentioning Semenya at the seaside. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:14]
No, you said, what's that got to do with anything? 

Julien Laurens [00:28:16]
Cause, like, you know, I was about to go to the beach and then I thought, I thought I said some manual, but maybe. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:22]
No, you didn't. 

Julien Laurens [00:28:23]
You sure? 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:23]
Would you like us to let play? 

Julien Laurens [00:28:25]
Can we play it, producer? Jesse, please. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Okay, maybe I said it would be maybe. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:29]
No, you hundred percent said it. Maybe I'd have to go back and listen to it. 

Julien Laurens [00:28:32]
I think I deserve at least a few more points. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:37]
Already. Come back. Somebody has to referee this. 

Kelly Somers [00:28:43]
There is a vacancy going for a new host for the SPL pod. I'm done. I'm out of here. I, um, did also speak when I walked up the door. And then real estate guys producer Jesse couldn't be here today because he's on holiday. The rest of us had to be here in person, but apparently it doesn't apply to him, so. Fine. But he did tell me before the podcast that I was not allowed to accept who from you. I was also not allowed to accept any arguments, so if we could just. 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:06]
You can't stop us arguing. We do it all the time. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:09]
One person. Who did Jules actually go with last week? Sam. Don't interrupt Jules. 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:12]
He went with a wobie and you went with imbemo. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:15]
How did a wobi do? 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:16]
He got two. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:18]
How did you do? 

Julien Laurens [00:29:19]
Samino got six dogs. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:21]
Didn't ask about Somagno, did I? 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:22]
Uh, he got 14. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:24]
What does that mean? That means another one. 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:25]
It means another one for me. 

Julien Laurens [00:29:27]
Didn't you mention another name as well? 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:28]
Semenyo. He was my backup. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:30]
He was, yeah. So, yes. Okay, firstly, kudos to both of you. Semenyo, a good pick. He's actually made it into your wild card team. 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:36]
Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:29:36]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:36]
So well done. 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:37]
At least you are french pickers backing yourself. 

Julien Laurens [00:29:39]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:40]
But didn't back himself enough to actually pick. 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:41]
Pick him. No. He could have gone for a wavy. Right. 

Julien Laurens [00:29:43]
Anyway, yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:45]
Uh, so that's who you went with last week? Who are you going with this week? 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:49]
Nico? 

Julien Laurens [00:29:49]
Uh, Jackson or Nico Williams, if you want to call him like that. At this stage, I'm not sure anymore. Seven, uh .6 million. So he's a bit expensive compared to another forward, if you want, owned by 6.1% of the managers so far back to back return now from him. And yes, I know he misses a lot of chances. I know that, uh, he's not always the best in terms of positioning and in his own game, but it seems in good form. They've got Bournemouth away, Chelsea, and as we've mentioned as well, it's not just for this week. With the Chelsea asset like Nico, it's also for the few games to come. So he's got good stats overall. He touches the ball a lot in the box. He's got a lot of shots and everything, yet he's not clinical enough, but we know that. So be ready for a bit of a roller coaster if you bring him into your team or if you already have him, if you're the six person who have him, because he's going to be really frustrating. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:39]
He's just wagging me off because he's looking straight down the lens, convincing everyone yeah. The rest of us are chatting to each other, whereas Jules is like, no, listen to me. 

Sam Bonfield [00:30:49]
It's like trying to be president or something now. 

Julien Laurens [00:30:52]
It's just like. I know how campaigning. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:54]
Yeah. 

Sam Bonfield [00:30:54]
He's Niko Jackson's biggest fan. 

Julien Laurens [00:30:55]
Don't listen to them too. Just go for Nico Jackson or Nico Williams or another Nico Rosberg if you like Formula One. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:02]
Do you remember me talking about my friend that brought in the wrong jotter? You don't want to be. 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:05]
You can't bring in the other two one races around in a race. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:09]
So, yeah, Nico Jackson. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:10]
Okay. Thank you very much, Sam. 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:12]
I didn't have him, any of mine, so. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:14]
Makes you delighted. 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:15]
I know, right. Um, I've got Andy Robertson this week. Come on, stop moaning. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:22]
Any other world class player like. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:24]
No, because what she's done there. I'm not taking sides. But Trent is the one that we're all talking about. She's given a differential. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:30]
It's not under 10% owned. 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:31]
No, no. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:31]
But what I'm saying is then she's looked and found someone else that is less owned. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:35]
What do you want to share with? 

Kelly Somers [00:31:35]
Can provide an alternative. It's a very useful tip for managers to remember that they had actually picked. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:39]
Kai Havitz or something who was like 9.8%. Okay, sorry. Yeah. Andy Robertson. 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:45]
God, he's got a murderer. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:46]
No, come on. 

Kelly Somers [00:31:47]
I'm going to ask producer Jesse to find out how many people switch off at this point in the pod. Because if I want to walk out, there's a lot of people going. 

Julien Laurens [00:31:53]
People know exactly where I'm coming from. 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:55]
Andy Robertson, uh, he's going to face Forrest, um, who they've beaten in all of the last three Premier League matches between them. In that time, Liverpool scored seven goals. They've kept two clean sheet. And Robbo's also got an assist in that time, in those matches. Um, he started the season with three consecutive clean sheet. Obviously, most people are going to look at Trent, but if you can't afford Trent, then Robertson's a decent option. And, um, they're the only team in the league that have so far kept those three cleats. He's also had two attempts on goal, both of them coming from inside the box. And one of them's a big chance. Created five chances for the Liverpool teammates. Only Trent has created more chances than that at Liverpool. So I think if you are struggling to get a Liverpool defender because you can't afford Trent, then I really like the rob AP. I think the way that they're playing is good. 18 crosses so far. More than any other defender. He's going to get some attacking returns and there should be plenty of clean sheets. 

Kelly Somers [00:32:42]
Why are you not going for him then? Why are you going for Trent instead? 

Sam Bonfield [00:32:45]
Because I can afford Trent. And I think that's a good thing. 

Julien Laurens [00:32:47]
If you can afford Trent. Definitely. 

Sam Bonfield [00:32:49]
Because the way that Liverpool are playing, Trent is the most attacking and has the set piece threat as well, which Robbo doesn't have. But at 6 million and as a differential in the game, you can go for Robertson and have have good pick from the, uh, Liverpool. Uh, basically the Liverpool attack, but with a defender. 

Kelly Somers [00:33:08]
But you've not got any Liverpool defence in your wild card. 

Julien Laurens [00:33:10]
No, but Robertson is definitely a good shot, as we said, if you want to move Pedro Poirot out, for example, for Robertson or even Saliba, considering again the two games against spurs and City, both away, where Arsenal can get clean, uh, sheets in both, but I think it's still very light, very unlikely then Robertson for Saliba. Even just for now, even just for the next two weeks, if you prefer, then I think it's a good idea. 

Kelly Somers [00:33:33]
Too, bringing it back to the Semenya conversation because we did mention him on your wild card. Sam. Um, we had a mill Smith row. You've still got a mill Smith row like me, correct? 

Sam Bonfield [00:33:42]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:33:42]
Don't look very happy about it. Jules and I, uh, I'm the 5.5 million midfielder club because I've also got Morgan Rogers, who Jules has also got. If we're looking in that price bracket before, maybe those two would have been head and shoulders above maybe the likes of Semenya. But would you now say if you're looking for a 5.6 million midfielder, Semeno is the best option? 

Sam Bonfield [00:34:04]
Yeah, I think he's up there. Definitely. There's him, there's Minta. I think those two are probably. Probably the standouts. Maybe Onana as well at Aston Villa's putting his hand up even cheaper. 

Julien Laurens [00:34:14]
Yeah. 

Sam Bonfield [00:34:14]
To be kind of considered, I think. 

Kelly Somers [00:34:16]
Brought him in in my draft this week. 

Sam Bonfield [00:34:18]
He's the same price as Rogers. 

Kelly Somers [00:34:19]
As you can tell, I'm taking draft seriously this year. 

Sam Bonfield [00:34:21]
You're enjoying your draft game this year. 

Kelly Somers [00:34:23]
I'm not bottom of that league, so it's quite nice. 

Sam Bonfield [00:34:26]
Um, yeah, I think so. I think that there's a bit of a changing of the guard in that five and a half bracket in terms of like we've got. And that's why game week three, game week four, game week five. They're really useful for us because you start to get an understanding of the teams in good form, the players in good form, the positions that they're going to take in the pitch and where they're going to play for those teams. So yeah, I think so. I think Semenya is looking like a really, really nice option right now. 

Kelly Somers [00:34:47]
It's also a really nice price bracket this year because there are some nice options in there and it's a price bracket we need to look in. Maybe in previous years we'd have looked at 6.5 as being our uh, cheaper midfielder but now with this whole Salah Haaland conundrum it's nice to have those options, isn't it, Jules? And you must have kind of not had a headache but it's nice to have a few options for you to pick from and you're welcome. 

Julien Laurens [00:35:06]
No, you're right. And you look and if you can't afford semen, for example, Justin Clover has done quite well at 5.4. You've got Jacob Murphy who. Okay. He's probably more of a serve. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:15]
I thought he was going to be better than he was. 

Julien Laurens [00:35:16]
I know because he was great in preseason. Yeah, very good. And he might. His entrance against spurs was decisive and really good. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:23]
Had him on my draft, but I sold him for Onanna. 

Julien Laurens [00:35:26]
Onanna is another one, as we mentioned. Um, if you like, told him. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:30]
Is that the word you use in draft? No, it's probably, yeah. Okay. Good transaction, isn't it? Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:35:35]
Um, but yeah, like I think there's really some good options uh, that you can find around that price of the between five one and five five. Really if you've got it will be. For example, I know last week. I know last week didn't work out. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:48]
You're really gonna go there again? 

Julien Laurens [00:35:48]
No, I'm just gonna dingra for Brighton if you can't afford Mitoma and if you prefer dingra to Minte, this is also possible. So yeah, there's a lot of really, really good options that you can get. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:58]
Okay, let's move on then to transfers and captains. Best of luck I should say, with your differentials. Please can there be no arguments next week? That's what I'd like, yeah. Transfers and captains then obviously last week was more of an overview. We didn't have this section, but it is just a few days until game. Week four resumes. Who are we going with? 

Sam Bonfield [00:36:16]
Well, if we, captain, you've got Salah transfer. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:18]
It's going to be hard, isn't it, for us this week? Yeah, because Salah's this, if you have Salah. You captain Salah, right? 

Sam Bonfield [00:36:24]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:25]
Your captain in my presume. 

Julien Laurens [00:36:26]
So it's him or Haaland are, uh, home to Brantford, really. But yeah, I think Sulligan's forest is probably. 

Sam Bonfield [00:36:31]
He's slightly terrified about. 

Julien Laurens [00:36:33]
Don't get him. He's over. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:34]
I'm terrified. No, I'm terrified about it. But there will be people that don't have Haaland as well. And also, at least Haaland has a nice fixture. Imagine if Haaland was going away to. 

Julien Laurens [00:36:43]
Arsenal and Haaland is back to back hatchery. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:45]
Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:36:47]
Although he could not score against Kazakhstan with Norway, which was really bad, and he was bad. Then he got a goal against Austria, uh, on Tuesday night. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:58]
My point is, I think we'd feel a lot worse about it if Harlow had a different fixture having Brentford at home. It could be. It could be a trip to Arsenal. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:06]
Yeah. And look, he is still only 42% owned, so it's not like he's owned by 70% of the game. Salah. And I think that's the other thing that in previous seasons, like, if you didn't have Salah, it really hurts. This is going to hurt. But as long as Haalanda does as well, it's going to cover itself. I mean, obviously I'd rather be in a position where I've got both of them, but that's a headache as well. 

Julien Laurens [00:37:30]
If I run, it's Holland. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:31]
But I think you'll go Salah. 

Julien Laurens [00:37:33]
It could be. It could be Salah. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:34]
Yeah. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:34]
Because he'll want to be different to us and he knows we don't have Salah. You don't have Salah, if you can mention it. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:40]
Differential. Um. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:41]
Yeah, I mean, I think there are other options, though, this week. Like, if you are one of those. 

Julien Laurens [00:37:45]
People that other options. Yeah. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:47]
Gone without any of Salah. I mean, Salah and Harlan are standouts, but if you're brave, like, you've got Palmer, who has got a relatively nice fix, you've got Jenkins, who's got a nice fixture. Like, there are other options that you could go to if you go for. 

Julien Laurens [00:38:02]
Joel Pedro at home to Ipswich if he plays. Because again, he played 45 minutes, uh, on Wednesday night. Tuesday night. Yeah. The second half against Paraguay did very little. But yeah. So. So home to Ipswich, for Brighton. It's hard to get better than that. 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:19]
I'm going Harlan, I'm going. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:21]
We're going Harlem because we don't have salad. Let's be honest. It's not. 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:24]
That is an option. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:25]
Is he an option for this week. If you don't have salad, does it cover it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:28]
I think Louis Diaz is an option as well. If you've got Luis Diaz, uh, do. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:31]
You not wish you had Luis Diaz rather than Jota at the moment? 

Julien Laurens [00:38:34]
Lias played twice, 90 minutes with Colombia. That's all I would say. 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:38]
And also, I don't think it's worth the sideways transfer of those two. If you're wildcarding, it's totally different. But I think if you're just not wild carding, I don't think it's worth it. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:46]
If you were wild carding and you were committing to go without salah, because some managers will still be wild carding and maybe thinking maybe it's to get Haaland in or something. I don't know. And maybe they've decided that they can cover Salah. Would Diaz be the best option now? 

Julien Laurens [00:38:59]
Diaz and Trent probably can cover Salah, to be fair, in a way, and I know it's still a lot of money that you are committing to those two players, but if you don't want Salah, for whatever reason, going for Trent and Diaz, I mean, Diaz and Trent, I know it's two players v one, so it's slightly different, but could get you more points than Salah on a weekly basis. So that's another good option, even if that means that it takes you two players to cover for one. So I know, I understand the imbalance of it, but still, I guess the best option, really, is to go for Trent. And the other. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:35]
Nice option, but we wouldn't do it. No, but, yeah, just trying to offer up different, um, different solutions for people, I guess, um, because all of our teams will be different. Okay, then transfers. Sam, are you ever going to make that transfer? 

Sam Bonfield [00:39:46]
Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:47]
And that's the one you're going to do. 

Sam Bonfield [00:39:48]
I'm 100% bringing Trent for Guardiola. Yeah. I mean, I can go Barco to Trent. I've got the money in the bank to do that. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:54]
Oh, I show off, but I don't. 

Sam Bonfield [00:39:56]
Think I want to do that. I think I'd run off the cake. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:58]
Sorry, but that is some upgrade. A player that's on loan, not even in this country, to one of the best right backs in this country. 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:03]
I would say I could do that. I could go, but then I've got more headaches, and I think I'd rather keep the money for later. I kind of waited just in case. So there was a moment where I thought, England don't play till Tuesday night. If Saka was to get injured, I had the money to go Saka to Salah, but I didn't want to do it if Saka was fit. So I've now, uh, we've got for internationals. I think I'm just going to do Vardy, Alta, Trent. That's what I've been talking about for two weeks. So I think that's what. Well, I am bringing in Trent. It's just Barco or bardio. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:28]
I can do that, but I'm toying with whether I go Gavardiol to Robertson just to keep a little bit of money in my bank. But I don't know. And also because I don't want to do exactly the same as you. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:41]
I think it's a fair move to go from Gvardiol to Trent, considering their prices at this time of the season after what's been quite disappointing. Start from Guardiola. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:49]
Yeah, we had a chat about him last week, didn't we? 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:51]
Yeah, we did. Yeah. That's what I'm doing. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:53]
Okay. Um, Jules, you've made a lot of transitions. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:56]
Loads of. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:58]
Anything else you would like more to come? 

Julien Laurens [00:40:59]
I mean, maybe Robertson could come and then maybe that. 

Sam Bonfield [00:41:03]
Basically the whole of that midfield is different apart from Rogers, right? 

Julien Laurens [00:41:07]
Yeah. Rogers are kept, uh, and the rest is different. And the thing is, if Odegaard is really ruled out by Arteta for Sunday. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:13]
Yeah. What do you do then? 

Julien Laurens [00:41:14]
Then Harvard's as a number eight. I don't trust him as much. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:17]
Pedro. 

Julien Laurens [00:41:18]
So I could go for somebody else, like a Pedro Poro. That then gives me more money. 

Sam Bonfield [00:41:22]
Pedro Poirot, he's obsessed with Pedro Poirot. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:25]
Nico, Nico, Pedro, Pedro. 

Julien Laurens [00:41:30]
All of them. Yeah. So harvest as an eight is not as appealing, obviously, than Harvard is a nine. 

Sam Bonfield [00:41:36]
So would you downgrade him if Odegaard sprawled out? 

Julien Laurens [00:41:39]
Because then after that, they play city. And if Odegaard is out for those two games, then I'm like, okay, Havertz. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:44]
Okay, what will you do? 

Julien Laurens [00:41:45]
So then I'll do probably Nico Jackson or Joel Pedro, and then bring Havertz back from game week six, basically. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:53]
But you need to put your bank in all those transfers. 

Sam Bonfield [00:41:55]
It's all about the planning to have it. 

Julien Laurens [00:41:57]
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:58]
Okay. Um. Well, the best of luck with that. 

Julien Laurens [00:42:01]
You're so smart. I mean, even me. I'm not amazing, really. All my planning, to be fair, I'm. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:05]
A little bit envious. I do really like the look of that team. Um, and I know Sam does. She just doesn't want to admit it. So the best of it, it's quite a nice. Jules, you're an Arsenal fan. It feels like this week there's going to be a lot of attention on, uh, Arteta's press conference. When does he normally hold his. Is it Fridays? 

Julien Laurens [00:42:20]
Yes, but I believe it could be today, even Wednesday. No, sorry, Thursday. Sorry, tomorrow. Because usually we were gone on Thursday. That's why I was a bit lost. So, yeah, it could be as early as Thursday. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:28]
Okay, well, keep an eye out, out for all the updates from that. They'll, of course, always be on fantasy dot Premier League.com and on the Premier League app. But, yeah, it feels quite important. Whether Odegaard is fit could have a big bearing on our other Arsenal assets. Could be good news for Saka, could be good news or bad news for Havertz. We'll have to wait and see. Um, and in general, I always find I pay a lot more attention to managers press conferences after an international break, 100%, because they might give an indication if the South Americans are going to play and all those kind of things. They're quite scary, actually. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:58]
Yeah, this is the. Coming out of an international break is the one I always worry about the most in terms of, like, rotation, things like that. So keep an eye on what the managers have got to say and try and cover it. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:07]
Okay. Enjoy the rest of your international breaks. Uh, Jules, you've actually not been jet setting during this one, have you? 

Julien Laurens [00:43:13]
No, I was supposed to go and I kind of had a feeling France would be terrible and they were against Italy, so I was like, you didn't. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:17]
Go, Sam, what about you? What have you got the next few days? 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:20]
I. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:21]
Other than sitting, listening to managers press conferences, I've put you on the spot there, haven't I? 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:24]
I will be listening to all the managers press conferences and then I will go, um, I'm going to spurs on Sunday to watch the north London. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:30]
You're going to be there, Jules? 

Julien Laurens [00:43:31]
Uh, no, I'm at the BBC five live in Manchester, so that's a good chance I'll be watching. 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:35]
Can't argue at a football match as well as here, no one lot of. 

Julien Laurens [00:43:37]
Arguing are weak enough, but when you go there in the north London derby, they usually lose first. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:42]
And on that note, thank you very much to everyone who stayed with us despite all of the arguing, it's been great to be back in person this week. A reminder, your deadline is 11:00 a.m. on Saturday. That's 90 minutes ahead of Southampton versus Manchester United off the bench. We'll be back on Monday. It'll be Lian as this week, talking you through all of the game week four talking points. We will also be back with the fantasy show on Friday. Um, I think it's fpl Harry with me. I haven't actually double checked. If it's not Harry, looking forward to seeing you soon. If it's someone else, whoever you are, you're more than welcome to join me in the studio. But looking forward to it is Harry. I think it's him with me for the first time. Uh, I think I'll end this podcast here because I don't know what I'm doing on Friday. And we'll be back with the podcast at the same time next week of Thursday. We've been with you earlier on a Wednesday because of the international break, but we'll be back, back at our usual slot, so you can listen to us where you get your podcast from next Thursday. Bye, guys.
