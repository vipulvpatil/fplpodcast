An interesting pod this week, if we do say so ourselves. We talk frustrating forwards. We give our view on villa as their fixtures turn. Does anyone know if Ed Sheeran plays fpl? Hello. Welcome back. It's Thursday. Erling Haaland went crazy last week. None of us triple captained him, but we're still in a good mood. Hello, Sam M. Bondfield. Hello. Julian, Lauren. You're both on holiday? Jules, where are you? 

Julien Laurens [00:00:29]
Hello, guys. I'm in France. I'm on ile Dore as, uh, usual. 

Kelly Somers [00:00:32]
Yeah, it looks beautiful. It's lovely. Had a few wi fi issues, but we've got there commitment to the podcast this morning. Tried a few different positions, but you're in one where hopefully the wifi is going to hold out. And Sam, where are you? 

Sam Bonfield [00:00:43]
I'm in Italy. I'm in Naples. 

Kelly Somers [00:00:45]
Lovely. I'm in London. But I'll be on holiday next week, so I'll make you jealous next week. Um, let's talk then a little bit about game week two before we go any further. It was game week two, wasn't it? Yes, it was seven. Week three is coming up. How did it go for you, Jules? Were you happy overall? As I mentioned, we weren't brave enough to go with Harlan, so congratulations to those who did. 

Julien Laurens [00:01:02]
Yeah, we thought about it, didn't we? We discussed it last week's show as well. It was a bold move. It was, in a way, a, um, successful move because the hat trick, uh, although it didn't start that well when he switched course first. And after that, the man city machine and the Haaland machine just got into the groove of things. Only time will tell if it was the right time to play the triple captain in game week two or if at some point later in the season there will be a better opportunity for us to get as, uh, many points or more points, maybe even. But well done to the ones who triple captain, because for now that was clearly the right call. I was certainly not brave enough to go for it. I thought about it like all of us, I think, but I was definitely not brave enough. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:42]
I didn't even really think about it. Sam, I'm going to be honest, because for all the reasons we discussed in terms of him still getting back up to speed and stuff like that, and a man city side still getting back up to speed. So I'm going to make myself feel better by thinking, imagine how many goals he can get when they are fully back up to speed. If maybe they are now fully back up to speed, though. I don't know. And I'm delighted to see who they got in the next round of the, uh, EFL cup as well. Actually, Shane, there's no FPL points available for that. Yeah. Do you regret it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:02:13]
Uh, no. I mean, I must admit I think I was a bit closer to doing it than maybe you were. Uh, but that was because on Friday I was having dinner with my eldest and he said, mom, should I triple captain Harlan? And we had a whole conversation over dinner about the pros and the cons for it. And in the end he was like, I'm gonna do it. So he did do the triple captaincy on Harlan got 107 points last week. And I was like, I think I'm just gonna wait it out. And he was like, but, uh, why wouldn't you just captain him with me? And I was like, I think like you said, kells, I want to wait for City to be in top form. And then when I saw the team sheet and it didn't have Foden at all, I was like, oh, maybe I have done the right thing here. Bye. Waiting. Actually, as it happened, it probably was the wrong thing. Because in reality, I mean, he was the, uh, fifth highest scoring triple captain ever across the game. And the only people that beat him were double game week scores. So when you think about it that way, the chances of you getting such a big haul again are quite small. But, you know, it is Manchester City and it is Haaland and you don't have to play it there. It could go on Salah at some point. There are other, other options too. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:15]
Yeah, so you mentioned it there. The fifth highest triple captain of all time. That was by 4770. 7386. Managers, congratulations if you're one of those, uh, the most triple captains ever given to a player in single game week. That's right, isn't it, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:03:32]
That's right. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:33]
And the fifth most of all time. The rest came in double game week. So. Yeah, just to clarify that. But of course, Harlem wasn't the highest scoring player in game week two. That honour went, perhaps surprisingly, to Chelsea's Madueke, who registered 20 points for his hat trick in Chelsea's six two win away at Wolves. I'm not sure I've ever. I was only listening on the radio, but followed such a bonkers game of football. It was so unbelievably open. Could have gone either way. And then for the fact that at, uh, halftime it went. Was it three two at halftime? And then it went six two. Cole Palmer as well, tied level on points with Harlem for the week, racking up 17 for three assists and a goal. Uh, there's plenty to ponder for us in that, isn't there, Jules? 

Julien Laurens [00:04:10]
Yeah, a lot. Because if you look at all the stats and if you just watch the game again, Wolves have a higher expected goal than Chelsea, for example, who did score six for unexpected goals of less than two, uh, and less than the opponent. So Uriah could have gone either way. Just the Madriga m hat trick in the space of 14 minutes just changes the game obviously completely. There's one that is deflected. One goal is deflect, is a deflected shot. But him and Palmer really set that game on fire in the second half. Especially the problem with Madueke is not so much the talent because he's a very talented kid, there's no doubt. It's just the consistency. And he is, I think, capable of hat tricks and games like he had at, uh, Wolves last weekend, and also games where he's completely anonymous and he's not even guaranteed yet to be a starter at, ah, Chelsea under Maresca, he was not under Pochettino last season. So this is the only thing. So right now it was the game of his Chelsea career, really, let's be honest. But I'm m not sure if he can do it again. For example, this weekend in game week three coming and etc, etcetera. So for Madriga, we need a bit more confirmation, maybe for Palmer, it's just good to see him back at this kind of level because the start of the season has been slow. Game week one and even before that, uh, post euros. And now it looks like it was the palmer of last season that we saw again. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:26]
Yeah, his goal was outrageous, wasn't it? Also though, George, I'm not sure we actually need that headache because I don't think any of us can find the money to get gold bomber in our team. So if Madueke could actually produce that on a regular basis, a bit like Jossa with Salah, it would give us a lovely other route into the Chelsea tack. Now, before we move on and discuss the EFL cup and also look ahead to game week three, I'm going to get in trouble with a few of the listeners that do like to keep track of how we're all doing. We've spoken about what we didn't do in terms of triple captain in Harlem. But Sam, you finished on 82 points. Jules, you finished on 73 points. I once again was the worst, only just on 69 points. I'm not too happy with my team, but Sam, um, in any other week, I'd probably be vaguely happy with 69, but it feels like it's been a pretty high scoring start. 

Sam Bonfield [00:06:08]
It has been. 

Kelly Somers [00:06:09]
Please tell me that that's just not me making myself. 

Sam Bonfield [00:06:12]
No, it has. Because when you think about it, everybody that's been popular to own in the game has returned points for people. So even like last week, Karl Palmer did nothing but certainly made up for it in game week two. Um, same with sun. Didn't get anything in game week one, but made up for it in game week two. Sakur consistently returning at the moment. Same with Salah, same with Harlan. So all of these kind of big, premium assets that are highly owned in the game, they all are returning regularly at the moment. And when that happens, you then end up with much higher averages because those players are the ones that obviously most people have in their, in their team. So I can understand your frustration, Cal, particularly when you think about the people that had triple captain Hannan and got 51 out of him alone. Like, that's obviously going to inflate, inflate the average that you get for the week. So, yeah, it's going to be interesting. And I think I was quite intrigued to see the number of triple captains, which we'll talk about later. It was funny because I was pondering around this script last night, and Lee was like, oh, by the way, I've wild carded this week. And I was like, I'm sorry, you've done what has it? Yeah. And I was like, how have you spent all week with me? And I've just been told about this right now. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:18]
We're spotting marital problems here, John. 

Sam Bonfield [00:07:20]
Yeah, tell me about it. I was like, you're joking that you've done this without telling me? Um, and I was like, why? And he was like, well, because suddenly there's a lot of other players that are starting to perform, and I feel like a couple of the ones I've got are wrong. And I like, he had nkunku, um, and people like that. And I think it's becoming a bit clearer now. And you always get this, don't you, after sort of 180 minutes of football, where you start to be able to see the players that you really want and the players that you don't. And so I can understand why this week has become a bit of a World cup week for people. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:48]
I need to start tearing you up with what I'm actually meaning to ask you. That was a brilliant answer, Sam, but the listeners also want to know how your team did. 

Sam Bonfield [00:07:55]
Oh, uh, my team? Yeah, it was fine. I got 83. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:58]
It was really good. 

Sam Bonfield [00:07:59]
Yeah, 82. Sorry. I think. Do you know, Kelly, I was a bit annoyed though by it because there were so many players in there that were like that. Ipswich goal frustrated me so much because having vardiol not get a clean sheet in a home m game. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:11]
Your defence did really well. 

Sam Bonfield [00:08:13]
Yeah, it did. And that's the other problem is I look at the back line of Saliba, Porro and Robinson who got six, six and seven. And then sat next to them is Bardiel. And I'm like, you're an annoyance to me there. Particularly when I could afford to have Trent because I've got loads of money in the bank, weirdly. And then in midfield, um, they did well as well. So I had Smith row and Saka and Jota. Obviously all they returned. E sec's a conversation, I think now. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:35]
I agree. 

Sam Bonfield [00:08:35]
Yeah. Suddenly there's a conversation around him because that's two games that I really feel like he should have got more out of Southampton and Bournemouth. You would be expecting there to be big returns from him in those two. So, yeah, 82. It was a good week, but I can't help but feel it could have been even better. 

Kelly Somers [00:08:53]
Daws, you're weak. 

Julien Laurens [00:08:54]
Yeah. 73. Not too bad defensively. Very, very good. Areola in goal with the six points and Poirot and Saliba as well. I brought in Livramento hoping, uh, that Newcastle defensively would be strong enough. And Livramento is starting right back. Didn't really go according to plan, but that's okay. It happens. And then after that it was just like agree with Sam and some the ones who returned like Saka and Jota but had Rodgers in the team that had, I thought, a fantastic game against Arsenal and should have retired. 

Kelly Somers [00:09:23]
How is he not getting points at the moment? I've got him as well. 

Julien Laurens [00:09:26]
Yeah, he was mad, really. East side is a conversation. I've got kudos who have playing city now. So he's a conversation too. I guess so. Overall it was not. It's just not too bad. Uh, but 73 is just above the average of game week two, which is still not great. 

Kelly Somers [00:09:44]
You sound like you're not overly happy, Jules. Would you consider a wild card at this early stage? 

Julien Laurens [00:09:48]
No, I think it's too early. And you know, my OCD things, uh, that I've got sometimes. For me it's always second international break. The first. The first one feels so this September 1 always feels so early. And I just don't want to play too early. And then in four or five game weeks. I feel like, oh, I wish I could play now and I've played already after just two or three games, so I'm just going to wait. And now, because you can roll on up to five free transfers, I don't think you need to rush your wild card at all. 

Sam Bonfield [00:10:19]
The one thing I would say though, about rushing it is I'm not sure that because of the five transfers thing. 

Kelly Somers [00:10:24]
You look at it the other way. 

Sam Bonfield [00:10:26]
You can because this is what we, this conversation I was having last night is that like, Lee didn't make a transfer out of game week one and into game week two, so he's now got two, effectively that he'll have coming out of this wild card. So if there's any problems on wildcard, you've got that. But equally, you'd think if you wildcard now, you should get your team almost spot on. So if it's right, then you won't need to wild card again. You won't need any more transfer a couple of weeks after. Before you know it, by the time you get to the second international break, you've got five free transfers, so you've effectively got another mini wild card anyway. So I think there's two ways of looking at it. There's that I want to save it for a bit later because that feels logical and sensible. That's how my brain works as well. Or you go, well, I'll play it now and then I'll set my team up for the next four or five weeks so that by the time we get there, I won't have had to make any changes and then can use those role transfers as almost like a big mini wildcard and change half my team. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:18]
Sam, um, how much of his team I wish. Why did you send him and the kids out? I'd quite like to sit him down, um, on this podcast and grill him about who's in his. 

Julien Laurens [00:11:25]
You surely know his team already. You know, come on. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:28]
He didn't even tell her he played it. 

Sam Bonfield [00:11:30]
Well, he did. So last night I was like, why. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:32]
Is the wild card? 

Sam Bonfield [00:11:33]
Because the only reason this happened is because I was sat, we were sat together, I was doing the, oh, this. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:37]
Is like when you find out about an affair, but it's just an FPL, right? 

Sam Bonfield [00:11:40]
Exactly. So I'm sat there like doing this happily minds my own business, updating the fl scores. And I look over him and I was like, what chip have you got active? And he was like, uh, uh. 

Julien Laurens [00:11:51]
I said he didn't want to tell you. 

Sam Bonfield [00:11:52]
He was like, he mentioned on our livestream on Sunday that he was thinking about it because he had a few issues. And I said, you're being ridiculous, it's too early. And then, um. And, yeah, and then he obviously, at some point, goodness knows when, because we've been together 24/7 all this week, he's hit the, hit the rock. Maybe I was asleep or something, but he's. Yeah, so he's played it. So he's done it for people like Cole Palmer. Like, he wanted a route to Parma. He's got, um, players in there that he wasn't happy with, um, and he wanted to free up some money. So he wants to change out e sac. He wanted to deal with. He still had Solanke on his bench. He had Barco still. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:27]
Oh, gosh, you're making me. I've got all of these players. 

Sam Bonfield [00:12:29]
He had Enkunku and he was like, you know, when you look at it, and this is the conversation we were having, is that he's like, when you look at it, I've got. I had five players that I really didn't want in my team, plus I had, like five or six players that I really wanted to own, including Cole Palmer, and had no root to him unless you take some money out of elsewhere. So he's basically done that. So now his team's got Palmer and Saka, and it's still got Haaland in it, and it actually looks really nice. I was quite jealous when I was looking at it yesterday. I thought, m maybe that's a, uh. Maybe that's going to be a really nice option and probably something that I don't think I'll do it this week. Well, I won't now, but maybe the first international break, I might even play it next week. 

Kelly Somers [00:13:08]
I was going to say the first international break is next week, Sam. 

Sam Bonfield [00:13:11]
Yeah, it might even be next week because my team's actually started really well. I'm doing really well at the moment, so I don't want to change things unnecessarily. But I do look at it and think there are a few players, for example, this week, if Palmer performs well again or if Madowaki performs well, or however we want to look at it, like, if we get a performance out of Chelsea, maybe there is an opportunity there that I can kind of invest in because their fixtures are so nice for the longer term as well. 

Kelly Somers [00:13:38]
Yeah. Also, like the Solanki Isak headache all of a sudden, if we've got two forwards that aren't, um, performing two thirds of your frontline, then yeah, I think that kind of almost justifies it. Also interesting, isn't it, that we spent the whole of preseason, Jules, talking about how there wasn't much value in defence and how we thought it was going to be all the attackers. Don't get me wrong, the attackers are performing. But particularly, like when I looked at Sam's defence this week, I think it was the same for you, actually, in terms of, uh, Poirot, Saliba, uh, Robinson, I don't think you have Robinson, actually. 

Julien Laurens [00:14:04]
Yeah, no, no, you're right. And you know what? Looking at preparing for the show and looking at again what happened in game week two, only six forwards returned, which surely must be like a, like, uh, a record or something, because if you didn't have so Haaland, okay, most of the 60% of the manager, but if you didn't have Haaland, Jackson Welbeck, Joe Pedro Cunha and Trent Larsen, none of the other forwards got more than two points. So it's two, one or zero for every single other forwards out of those six ones. And even in those six ones, apart from Haaland, the others, okay, Joe Pedro, because he was quite cheap, but all the others are pretty low owned. So I've rarely seen a game week where actually, of all the forwards in the game, pretty much nobody returned outside of Haaland. And that's exactly what happened. So it's one of those weeks where we can have the discussion about Solanke and Isak and others too. But really, it was a bit of a freak of a game week because none of the forwards actually got points and did nothing. Not an assist, not a goal, just nothing. So it's a bit weird. And that's when you need your strong defense. And yes, we've said it, a lot of people have Poirot or Saliba. So it's a lot of the same defenders. Ok. Vargiol, in this case, didn't really work out, but he would normally. So you just have to find maybe the last of your defender is a bit of a differential. If he scores, then he's really good for you, those kind of things. Because forwards right now are not really reliable, to be fair. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:33]
Why do you think that is? Strange, isn't it? 

Sam Bonfield [00:15:36]
It is. It is a strange one. And actually, the forwards that have been reliable are the likes of Danny Welbeck, who, uh, are some of the most cheapest routes into the attack. And I think this season we saw a lot of value in the attackers. And maybe we've therefore put more of our budget into the midfield and attack slots than we normally would. I think usually, particularly in that forward line we would have two, well, one premium, probably another mid priced, and then a budget option. Because this year a lot of managers have decided to invest heavily in the forward lines and in the midfield. Our expectations, I think are significantly higher of these players. So we're like, well, I've spent 8 million on you. I spent eight and a half million on you. I'd expect you to be performing, particularly when you look at some of the defenders who are performing in the likes of Robinson who picks up seven points this week and is super cheap. So I think there's a weight of expectation there. I also think that for some of them it's like ESAC I do think has been a little bit unlucky. Obviously the sending off in game week one restricted the amount of opportunities that Newcastle had. Um, and then into game week two, Bournemouth were actually just really good in that game. So it might be that moving forward we see a little bit more consistency from those forward players and uh, maybe we don't need to panic on them straight away. Right now it is looking tougher to hold them because like I would really like to take Bardiel to Trent. And so I'm then thinking that's even more money in the defence, which feels counterintuitive to what we were talking about all of preseason. But it kind of feels like big at the back is back and maybe that's where I want to go. 

Kelly Somers [00:17:09]
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see, won't it? And with Solanki we still don't know fully, do we Sam? But is it expected after the international break? 

Sam Bonfield [00:17:16]
Yeah, so uh, poster Cogli hasn't really said anything yet but he. In the first match where he ruled him out of game week two he said we've got international break coming up. And that suggested to me that I'd expect to see Solanki back after that rather than for game week three. So we'll just all he is on the press conference on Friday just in case we get news on him. 

Kelly Somers [00:17:34]
So Sam, you sold for Muniz. Jules, what about you? What's your plan with Solanke? 

Julien Laurens [00:17:39]
I've kept him because poster Coglu also said it was just a knock. There was nothing serious or anything like that. To be fair I expected it to miss just one game, game week two and then be back for the Newcastle clash as in big teams, which I think he could. Uh. Right now the flag is 50% chances of playing this weekend. So I'm going to wait, but even I'm going to keep him anyway because I want him for after, I think eventually. Game week one. I think he was unlucky. He had those two big chances. We've said at the time his xG on that goal is 0.4 or something like that. So he had decent opportunity to score. Just didn't work out. But I think he will score goals for Spurs. I think he would be good because they're going to create so many chances for him. So I don't want to let him go and, and I want to keep him, even if right now there's that flag on him. I think he could play this weekend, but certainly he'll be back after the international break. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:29]
Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it, Sam? Um, as well, because I keep saying it's interesting, but I really do think the forwards are, uh, very interesting. 

Julien Laurens [00:18:34]
You're very interested. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:35]
I am. M. I've gone wildly off script here because I've just realised from talking, talking to you guys, the forwards are, uh, one of our biggest problems at the moment. It feels like we expected the defence to be the midfielders. All of these lovely options are popping up in terms of we know we want Salah, we know we could have Jota, uh, saka, Palmer. We're keeping our eye on Rogers. But then with the forwards, we all went with the three, exactly the same three at the beginning of the season. Sam's already veered away from that. Me and you, Jules, aren't quite sure what to do about Solanke. None of us are happy with Isakhdem. Obviously we're all happy with Harlem, but maybe Sam, there's two other spots up for grabs. And from all being quite boring at the start of the season, maybe it's time to be different. You've started it by going with Mooniz. 

Sam Bonfield [00:19:17]
Yeah, so I. And it was quite a last minute decision, obviously, when I spoke here last week we didn't know anything about the Sanki injury. And then on Friday afternoon when that news broke, I was like, I'm gonna do nothing. I'm just gonna leave him. I'm gonna do what George did. He can sit on my bench and then I'll fix him next week. And then I was looking at Fulham and I thought, uh, I don't know, I really fancy Fulham to do well this week. It was a nice game and in the end I thought, if I'm going to do potentially Salanki to Muniz next week anyway, why don't I just do it? This week for the Leicester game and then I'll be travelled up on Fulham, which feels a lot, but, you know, we don't have to stick with them forever. And I think that's the thing this year it does feel like this game is going to be a more, uh, flexible in our approach. We'll be able to move around the players a little bit more, but we won't have to stay quite so loyal and quite so wed to players. I think for me the decision was, well, let's just target this week then. Let's just target this week because I didn't really fancy Nkunku, particularly after seeing him start for Chelsea on the Thursday evening in their game. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:17]
You were really quite angry with him, weren't you? I could tell. I thought even when Solanki was fully ruled out, we did the, uh, fantasy show on Friday and you were like, oh, I could just start on Kunku if Solanki is definitely ruled out. And I was like, yeah, surely she'll do that rather than use a transfer. Checked her team, I was like, wow, she really didn't want Nkunku. 

Sam Bonfield [00:20:32]
I really didn't want to play in Kunku. I just didn't fancy him to get a start. And I actually, like, spoke to a number of Chelsea fans and they've all kind of 50 50 on it. And I was, I just don't fancy him to start. He started him on Thursday and then when the team sheet came out I was like, oh, I feel like I've got that one right. But obviously, you know, nothing for my knees. But I'm looking at my front line as being the areas where most of my chances will probably happen this year. Like, I feel like my defense is fairly well set and I'm probably just going to stick with them now. Not the goalkeeper he needs dealing with, but the defence itself. They're going to be fairly static, I think. So I'm looking at the forward line and I've got loads of money in the bank now because I've been selling Solanki and I'm planning to sell. Spoiler alert for later. I'm planning selling Kunku later on in the week. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:12]
I don't think that's that big a spoiler off. 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:13]
No, I don't think it is. 

Julien Laurens [00:21:14]
I expected something much bigger than Kunkku. 

Sam Bonfield [00:21:17]
Being sold but I'm actually, no, not doing anything raging this week. But yeah, I'm going to get rid of him and then. But that will give me like three and a bit million in the bank and having that level of money means I can kind of go anywhere and I wanted that over the international break because it means that if I want to go from ESAC to Watkins, I can. If I want to go from Munny's up to somebody else, I can. If I want to drop Mooniz down to a Jal Pedro or a Welbeck, I can. There's a load of flexibility that comes with that frontline and I think actually if you can play the frontline correctly, that's where you're going to get the majority of your returns over other people this year because I think most people are going to settle with the midfield and the defence and it'll be finding the differentials in the attack. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:58]
Jules, who are the best options then? You've said you're happy to wait on Solanki, but we've already mentioned that Isakhouse is potentially going to become a little bit of a problem. 

Julien Laurens [00:22:06]
Well, it could be. Although I mean, again, I think at some point it's just the start of the season. Let's not forget if we were mid season and Isak had been average for the first 18 games or something like that, then I think it would be a worry. Now it's just two games in. Sam explained rightly earlier, the first game, red card for sure after 25 minutes or something. So maybe Newcastle is just not up, uh, there in terms of match fitness and just hitting the ground running now. But it could happen against spurs this weekend, for example, when they back, you know, that would be so spursy, uh, Sam and then they've got Wolves and Fulham for example. So for Isak I'm not too worried. I think those kind of strikers usually at some point get into the groove and stuff. The difference compared to last season. Last season we were really lucky because Isak performed really well and Solanki and Watkins and Haaland and Havard for the second half of the season. Even Darwin, remember Darwin time. He had this period where he kept scoring. He became Darwin again and then that stopped. So we were really lucky because he felt easier in this one, as we've said. Look at game week two, not many forward performed and returned. So he's just finding the guy who you believe or feel that are going to do well in game week three, four and five, et cetera. It's just not easy because Jackson could be the one. But what we saw him scoring in game week two again, inconsistency with him is, as we know, might not do that in game week three. Watkins at some point surely is going to wake up. Same with Isak that we mentioned. What about ematteta or Harvard? Or maybe even Mbomo and the guys at Brentford who have replaced Tony? 

Kelly Somers [00:23:44]
Yeah, Vissa looks good, doesn't it? 

Julien Laurens [00:23:46]
Vissa as well. Liverpool. Jota right now is the number nine. But at some point, could it be Gakpo or could it be Darwin again? We saw Darwin coming on late in game week two, for example. So there's still a lot of things fulcruic started in the EFL cup for West Ham on Wednesday night. 

Sam Bonfield [00:24:02]
So I don't think. 

Julien Laurens [00:24:03]
Yeah, I don't think he will start the weekend and Antonio should still keep that place, but at some point, full crook will start for West Ham. Hoylan is going to come back from injury, so then we will have more options. Right now. It's true, he feels a bit like I don't really know where to go. So for now, I'll keep Haaland, Isak and Solanki until his back fit. And then I can see Jules, it's. 

Kelly Somers [00:24:21]
Like you've learned over the past year or so that it's about the long game and strategy. You've got better at that, haven't you? 

Julien Laurens [00:24:27]
It's interesting what you. Because you're very interested, uh, this morning. Uh, no, no, you're right, actually. But also when this we've. 

Kelly Somers [00:24:33]
What do I keep saying? 

Julien Laurens [00:24:35]
I don't know, but I love it. In game week two, we said, let's wait a bit to see the trend. So. Okay, I don't know. Ss Emmanuel, for example, who's gonna. Could be one of my differential. Could be, could not be. But back, back to back return for him, great. But he might never return again, for all we know, until the end of his career. So let's just wait a little bit more. And others, maybe the bigger names can start returning now who haven't really returned so far, like a Watkins too, who should have scored against Arsenal. And really, if you and you watched that game a bit like erst Kells with Rogers, you would have gone crazy in front of your television. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:07]
Yeah, um, I like that phrase on the menu. And I'm really going to try and not say the word interesting for the rest of the podcast. 

Julien Laurens [00:25:14]
I mean. No, I just find some. Another, well, uh, like a synonym of interesting. It's fascinating, Jules, what you're saying. Yeah, fascinating. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:21]
I was intrigued, Sam, when I read this stat, though. Alexander Isak, you'll love this as well, scored a brace on the previous two occasions he's faced spurs at St. James's park with the aggregate score ten one to Newcastle. 

Sam Bonfield [00:25:32]
Yeah, we are terrible at St. James's park. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:34]
You can't stand him this week, can you? 

Sam Bonfield [00:25:35]
No, I wouldn't. And I'm a Spurs fan. Like, I'm holding him this week. Like, honestly, you'll get some pleasure when. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:40]
He scores, haven't you, Kelly? 

Sam Bonfield [00:25:42]
I never get any pleasure when spurs go to St. James's park. Honestly, it's a disaster every time. Uh, yeah, I'm going to keep him. 

Kelly Somers [00:25:48]
This week for sure. Okay. That's nice and simple then, wasn't it? Was very. What an interesting discussion. By the way, before we go any further, if I've been talking about all the value in defence, did any of you see who my third playing defender was last week? 

Julien Laurens [00:26:03]
Embarko. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:04]
No. 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:05]
No. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:05]
Even better. I wish. I wish it was. 

Julien Laurens [00:26:07]
You can't be better than the player who's not there. 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:09]
He was a wolves defender. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:10]
Yeah. Do you know what they finished on Sam Moscara? Well, they conceded six goals, minus two jewels. And I nearly last week brought in Robinson. But I didn't. I've, uh, done it this week. I didn't do it. And so it was basically a nine point swing. 

Julien Laurens [00:26:23]
What happened with Moscow? Why Moscow, though? What, like this? 

Kelly Somers [00:26:26]
Because he's my 4 million not meant for, obviously I had all of those problems and I was like, oh, yeah, I don't mind him starting. He'll just get me one or two points and I'll say, Kelly's problems just. 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:33]
Kept getting worse and worse last week, didn't they, Kells? With every press conference it was like, oh, I've got this one's out. I've got that one out. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:40]
And I just. By the end of it was just like, it's all right, I can rely on this bench. But I didn't need. If anyone had been injured, I would have had ten players. In hindsight, I wish I'd had ten players because that would have been zero rather than minus two. 

Julien Laurens [00:26:51]
That went 71. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:53]
Yeah, yeah. Thought about that. I'd gone over 70. That would have felt so much better than 69. Anyway, it's done, it's moving on. Unfortunately, I still haven't sold him because he at least plays, whereas I have other defenders that don't even get on the pitch. Although if you're going to get minus. 

Sam Bonfield [00:27:06]
Two, what's even won't happen again. It'll be fine. 

Kelly Somers [00:27:10]
Okay, just a quick EFL cup recap. As I said, I've gone wildly off script here because it felt like there were so many different talking points. I'm sure we'll talk about forwards in the coming weeks as well as Jules said as we find out more about them and get kind of more evidence. And the EFL cup, there was some interesting stuff in this. I watched Forest versus Newcastle last night. What else did you notice, Jules? Did you manage to watch many of these games? I, uh, know no matter where you are in the world you normally manage to. 

Julien Laurens [00:27:33]
I tried. I tried. To be fair. It was not easy last night, uh, because there was a lot of uh, going on and partying and everything like that. 

Kelly Somers [00:27:40]
You were on holiday with about 400 people, aren't you? 

Julien Laurens [00:27:42]
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I feel like uh, a tour guide in here to be fair, with all our friends. But anyway, Ipswich, I mean, if you thought the start of the Premier League was hard, which it was, to be honest, Liverpool and cities, you can't do harder than that. And then you thought, okay, then they play Wimbledon in the uh, EFL cup. Nobody even knows where Wimbledon are in which league and how well they're doing or not. And then guess what? Wimbledon knocked them out on penalties. So really terrible start from Ciaran McKenna and the boys. And I think the AFL at this time, the AFL cup usually is like, okay, finally we get a win. You kick start your season. A bit of momentum for the weekend in the Premier League, not for Ipswich. So that was not good at all. Ah, and Forrest as well, not that they need a bit of momentum because they've done okay so far in the Premier League but to lose against Newcastle in the AFL cup, which would have been one of their objectives. Let's try to do well in domestic cups. Not really this season. 

Kelly Somers [00:28:39]
Sam, anything you noticed? There were some quite big wins for teams in the Premier League that potentially really needed it as well. 

Sam Bonfield [00:28:44]
Yeah. I think seeing Everton and Palace get two fairly big wing and so is the Everton one. 30. Fulham won two nil, palace won four nil. I think when you're struggling like Everton have been over the opening two fixtures of the season, having that win underbelt doesn't really matter who it comes against. It just changes the momentum potentially. So I think they were going to be a team that we were going to target in FPL but maybe this changes them. To be honest. I still think they might be a bit of a team to target. Um, but the EFL does. It does kind of throw to light and sometimes you see new players that they start instead of ones that have been doing badly in the league and then they get the game time. Sometimes it has the opposite effect. Right. And you see them in the mid week, like in Kunku last week, and then you don't see them starting at the weekend. So I think it's just important to keep abreast of that, just to make sure that your players are doing well and no injuries, all of that good stuff, but most of the Premier League sides actually doing what they needed to do. 

Julien Laurens [00:29:40]
I just forgot quickly. Uh, West Ham beat Bournemouth one nil late. Jared Bowen scored again. So that's two in two now. Game week two he scored and then in the FL cup. So the momentum also works for players who maybe had a slow start. Game week one of the Premier League season for Bowen, for example, clearly hitting form now and the fact that he played the whole game against Bournemouth maybe needed a bit of that game time because he came back late, obviously, having been at the euros with Ukely, uh, for a whole month in Germany, the two of you. So now he came back late. So that was good for him. So if you were thinking about Bowen, I know he's 7.5, not cheap for your midfielder, but if you were thinking about him, it feels like right now it's a good time to get Bowen in your team also. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:23]
I can't believe we've spoken about it after talking about my friend getting the wrong jotter last night. But he was brilliant against Newcastle last night. So I texted her saying, you might have had the last laugh here because he came on and was brilliant. She was like, I don't get any FPL points for that. And I was like, well, that's true, but I'm just saying he might have played himself into contention. It didn't make her feel that much better. 

Julien Laurens [00:30:43]
There's a Jota who used to be a Celtic who then went to Saudi Arabia, just signed for. Tell her not to buy him either because this is not the right Jotar. It's another jotar as well. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:52]
But I'll pass that, um, on. Yeah, unless she starts playing French. Fantastic. 

Julien Laurens [00:30:55]
You never know. Just tell her even that jhota is not the right one. 

Kelly Somers [00:30:59]
I'll pass that on. Um, she does listen to this podcast so yeah, she'll be really grateful for that tip. Thank you. Let's talk fixture swings a little bit, Sam, because, um, we've actually already mentioned Aston Villa and they're really interesting now, aren't they? Because myself and Jules have been left frustrated. We put our faith in Morgan Rogers and I'm still absolutely adamant that at his price point, definitely he is going to be an absolute steal. And at some point this season, a lot of people are going to want to own him, but it is still getting frustrating. However, Villa in general, the top of the fixture ticker, people will start looking at him, particularly if he does start turning the potential into points. 

Sam Bonfield [00:31:32]
Absolutely. I mean, I use the game in game week two as an opportunity to kind of scout Aston Villa. We were out and about on Saturday and I said I need to be home for 530 because I want to scout a third arsenal asset and I need to scout Villa assets and work out which, particularly which Villa asset it is that I want. And actually, I think there were a number that kind of really stood out. So obviously your Rogers pick, like, I think as a cheap enabler, he looks fantastic. I mean, he's had five goal attempts in the opening two matches. Two of them have come from inside the box. He's created four chances. One of those has been a big chance. And when you think about, like game week two was against Arsenal, so that's not a game that you would expect them to be getting lots of opportunities and lots of chances. So in terms of those budget picks, I just think he looks like phenomenal value for money. And then you've got Watkins, who you would expect Watkins to have scored by now because of what he did last year. 

Kelly Somers [00:32:23]
How was he not? 

Sam Bonfield [00:32:23]
Well, exactly. I mean, he was second for expected goal underachievers in game week two. So he was the player who didn't score that was expected to score the most. Apart from he was second for that. He's had two attempts on goal, both from inside the box, both of them classified as big chances. He's created two chances in the 124 minutes that he's played so far this season, which when I read that station, I was like, well, that feels quite low. I wonder what his chances created stats were last season because obviously last season he was phenomenal at creating opportunities for his teammates. And actually last season he was creating a chance every 70, um, one minutes. So obviously there's a wider pool of games to look at there, but that basically means that he's creating a chance every 62 minutes at the moment in comparison to every 71 last season. So he's actually been more creative at the moment than he was last year, if you look at the underlying stats. So I think if you've got Olly Botkins, you hold. I think the bigger question is, do you invest this week? Because as you say, they're top of the fixture ticker. Uh, but he hasn't yet got off the ground running. But if you go early and he does return, then you're on him for this. Really nice. You get the whole run or you decide. Okay, I'm going to give Isak another week because all that stuff you've just said about spurs at St. James's park, and then you move from Isak to Watkins next week if Isak doesn't return. I think those are the kind of conversations that managers are going to need to have for me. I'm going to hold Isak for one more week because I know what spurs do. Um, and then I'll move for Watkins next week if Isak doesn't return against us. 

Kelly Somers [00:33:57]
Yeah, I brought Morgan Rogers in to kind of COVID that villa attack. That was. That was my thinking. He was a cheaper way. I imagine it was similar for you as well, Jules. I also noticed that you've had Esri Konza, uh, on your bench, but I imagine he might start getting a few starts for your team now, given the way these fixtures change. 

Julien Laurens [00:34:13]
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, Rodgers has turned into prime, uh, brazilian Ronaldo in the two games that he played. And I know, I know, Jules, where's he from? 

Kelly Somers [00:34:22]
Which country is he gonna play for? 

Julien Laurens [00:34:23]
I don't know. I wish he was from Paris because I could then brag and say that he's one of mine, but he's not. But what has been really interesting, because you arrived from, obviously, Midas, bro, in January last year season. So he had those six months almost in the Premier League to adapt, but he played out wide very often on the left hand side. Now he plays just behind Watkins as a second striker or another striker, whatever you want to call it. And I think this is much better for him, obviously, because you're more central and you're closer to the goal than when you are on the left or on the right hand side. The left, especially for him. So that change of position, I think, has really benefited from him. Uh, I think he's all around game is what Unai Emery really, really likes. And as we said, they've been really unlucky. The thing with Konsa, with Matikash's injury. Now, Konsa could also play right back like he did with England, uh, or like he played for most of last season as well with Villa and Diego. Carlos could come in and play with Pao Torres at the two centre backs and then Ding. Or Matzena left back for Villa. So whoever replaces Cash, I don't think that will impact Konsa. It just means that if you have Konsa, he will either start a right back or a centre back. I just benched him against Arsenal because I expected Arsenal to score and so they did. So I kept Saliba on my team and then put Konza on the bench. But Konza is definitely backing the team for this weekend because against Leicester I think Vela would be very solid and Konsa should return. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:44]
Cash's injury could potentially open up some other nice options, couldn't it? Really, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:35:49]
Absolutely. And I think you can stay with Villa and you can go. 

Julien Laurens [00:35:54]
For who? 

Sam Bonfield [00:35:55]
For a con for. You can go for Konza if you want. You can go. They've got a 4 million now. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:00]
No. 

Julien Laurens [00:36:00]
Yeah. I can't remember m his name. Sorry. 

Sam Bonfield [00:36:04]
Right. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:05]
I'm staying quiet here. 

Sam Bonfield [00:36:06]
I'll make an attempt. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:07]
I can spell it. I just can't say. 

Julien Laurens [00:36:09]
It's just how hard you try not to pronounce his name. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:12]
I could say it. 

Julien Laurens [00:36:13]
I was never gonna let you off this way. 

Sam Bonfield [00:36:15]
Nadel Kovich Najelkovich. I think it is, isn't it? 

Julien Laurens [00:36:19]
I'll call him by his first name. His first name is easy. 

Sam Bonfield [00:36:21]
Costa. Yeah, but Costa and Konza might be a bit much. Um, yeah, I mean, and actually. So didn't we all get excited? Well, I certainly did. Anyway, watching that game, when he came on, I was like, oh, hello, barcode replacement. If Matty cash is out for a while, then this actually does make a lot of sense. Um, and we'll have to see exactly what the extent of Mattie cash's injury is. But he could be a really nice option if he directly replaces him because he's only going to cost you 4 million. Most people in the game seem to have a barcode shape problem or another 4.0 problem if you've gone off your walls. One, um, Kelly, because he's got let you down, then absolutely. He could be a nice option. So it won't be a long term option, though, because I would expect when Matt cash is fit that he would come straight back in. But as a short term punt, if you are looking to wild card in the next three, four weeks, then could be a good option. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:12]
I feel really bad that I didn't know how to say his name. I pride myself on making sure I. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:16]
Should have listened to the video. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:18]
Yeah, we'll definitely do that for his massive twelve point haul this week. And when I bring him into my team, um, elsewhere aside from Villa. So they do top the fixture ticker at the moment. Below them is Ipswich, then Chelsea. We've already briefly spoken about Chelsea and maybe needing a little bit longer to scout their options before we decide if Madueke is worth the kind of investment. Um, and Kunku, we've got a few headaches over him, particularly Sam Ipswich as well. It's tough to invest in them because of all the reasons we've said. They had a tough start in the Premier League. They've had a tough start in the cup as well. But maybe the only option. Sami Smodek scored at the Etihad Jewels, then 4 million defender Ben Johnson as well. I've seen him on a few people's benches. He got the assist as well. Are they the only ones you'd look at? 

Julien Laurens [00:37:59]
I mean, I wish I could sign Ed Sheeran. I'm kidding. You've switched fans? I'm only kidding, George. 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:05]
Do you have Leif Davis in your team? 

Julien Laurens [00:38:07]
No, I swapped for Livramento, which was a terrible idea, uh, to be honest. So, no, no, I don't have him anymore. But no, I think you can. If you look at the fixtures, as we've been saying, much easier. I mean, it could not have been Liverpool and City to start, but Fulham, Brighton, Southampton Villa. I've just. I know. Small. He scored and he was obviously outstanding in the championship last season with Blackburn. I just don't see how. I just think this is so. This is the worst out the scene that they could have had. But again, Liverpool and City, they probably expected to lose both games. I just haven't seen enough. Even that first half against Liverpool. Yeah, that was good. And we said they fought hard and they won duels and second balls. Great. That doesn't bring you any points in FPL, though. And I think there's a point where I just need to wait. If ever I would go to an Ipswich player, just wait a little bit to see if there's a smudge that can be just outstanding for them over a few games. Otherwise, I'm not sure it's really worth it. Sorry, Ipswich. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:08]
And Ipswich, you've tried your best there. Uh, maybe in a few weeks we'll be talking. They have had such a tough start and I'm sure things are going to pick up because it's not every week you have to play Liverpool in the Manchester city, is it? Okay. Differential of the week because we've gone wildly off script completely. My own fault differential of the week is going to be a speedy differential of the week this week. You know the drill by now. These guys pick a player who is under 10% own that they think could provide points this week and potentially even beyond last week. Congratulations to Sam. I thought of you when James Madison got an assist. How did he not get more against Everton? I know that party. That's ended after one week. 

Julien Laurens [00:39:44]
I mean, you know, let me just say, uh, this was the worst ever differential pick in the history of this game. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:50]
I'm glad you said it. 

Julien Laurens [00:39:51]
He had zero shots. I think he had six passes. He played 71 minutes. I would have done better. I think he had, like, literally that. Twelve touches of the ball. Twelve touches. One of them, I mean, one being kickoff. Either the first one or after halftime, one was the other kickoff after the first. I mean, worst pick ever. I'm sorry. If anybody listened to my, uh, Vardy, Jamie Vardy, the party pick, I thought. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:14]
I'd never see this on this podcast, Joel's holding his hands up. He got something wrong, but that was quite the admittance. Come on, then. Oh, no, it's the winner, isn't it? I let the winner go first. Sam, who are you going with? 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:23]
So I. George, you mentioned some in you earlier. I had him as my backup. I'll leave you in case you want him. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:28]
Um, no, no, I've got three, so I've got plenty, you know. 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:30]
Sorry, you've got three through it. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:33]
I give you them all. I give you those. It's like Christmas today. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:37]
It's because he's on holiday with loads of people. He's been using it as an opportunity. 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:40]
They've asked me, either that or someone else is an expert, and they're just feeding. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:45]
I'm the experts. Only amongst my friends. 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:48]
Uh, yeah, so I'll leave some Inu, because he was my backup. Anyway, if I'm going first, and I'm going to go for Brian Mbuamo this week, um, we've got Southampton at home. He's going to cost you 7 million, so he's not exactly a cheap option, but he's only owned by 5.2% of the game, which really surprised me, given how good he's been over previous seasons. So far, this campaign has created four chances, and, um, two of those have been big chances, and that's more than anyone else in the Brentford team. He has also had two further attempts on goal. Both of those have come from inside the box. He's produced four key passes, which, again, is more than anyone else at Brentford. And when Tony was out last season, Mbamo was absolutely brilliant. He really stood up, and I expect that that will happen again. He's going to face Southampton in game week three, whose underlying stats at the end of game week one looked great. But then they were playing against a ten man Newcastle side since then, um, Southampton have conceded seven big chances in the last two matches. That's the third most across the league. And I think actually had shar not been sent off in game week one, that seven big chances conceded would have been significantly higher than that because Newcastle didn't attack as much as probably they would have done if they were at full strength. So I think in bumos. So against Southampton, um, at home could be a really nice pick this week. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:00]
I like that. Jules, what about you? 

Julien Laurens [00:42:02]
So I don't know where to go really. I've got too many. So semeno was one of them. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:07]
I feel like I've started to think, you know, in the first week when I wouldn't let you have your first differentials, you've now come armed with like, loads. And when I want you to be quick on your differentials as well. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:15]
No, we're not. 

Julien Laurens [00:42:15]
Okay, no, I'll be quick. So Semeno is one good one. Five, uh .5 million owned only by 2.5% off the manager. 13 points already because he's, as we said, returned back to back one goal, one assist in the first two game weeks. He had twelve shots in those two game weeks. 16 touches in the opposition box, which is a lot. So that's good. Then. I had Iwobi too. I like Iwobi, uh, because Fulham play Ipswich and Ed Sheeran, uh, and he had eight points against Leicester. He was really good. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:42]
So Jules, find out if Ed Sheeran plays fpl, we get him. 

Julien Laurens [00:42:46]
Oh my God. Yeah, yeah, I will, I will, I will. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:48]
Yeah. I don't know why. I think you've got contacts with Ed Sheeran. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:51]
No, him and I, we hang out with Ed Sheeran. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:53]
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, but that was just like. 

Julien Laurens [00:42:58]
So it will be 1.1% owned, uh, 5.5 million as well because Smith row is heavily owned, obviously. So you could go for Iwobi as a differential. And I think the two of them, best friends, etcetera, they can, they can do well against, against, uh, Ipswich and then Savio is a very interesting one. But that's. That could be one for another day. I mean, I pick the one who does the best, obviously. 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:24]
No, you have. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:25]
Doesn't work like that. 

Julien Laurens [00:43:26]
What? Okay, so I will go for. So semen, quick differentials. You will be quick? It will be. 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:34]
Don't let everyone down again, please. 

Julien Laurens [00:43:37]
Go for Savio or, uh, Semeno and I will get the. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:40]
Okay. I'd like to. Thanks, Jules. I'd like to congratulate myself on being such a great host, I said quick differentials, and it was the longest one of the week. I have absolutely zero control over this podcast. Why do I even be I do two years ago. 

Julien Laurens [00:43:52]
No, it's interesting. I think it's really interesting. Kelly, what you're saying. 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:56]
Super interesting. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:57]
Oh, I'm bullied on m this podcast that I'm meant to host. Right. Let's try again. Producer Jesse, who we're giving fame to is going to kill me. I've just had a text with. We're not doing too bad for time. He's got to pick one differential. Kelly, he will be. 

Julien Laurens [00:44:10]
I said, alex, he will be Nigeria legend. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:14]
You've gone for Mbumo. You've gone for a while. Be they are our confirmed differentials. Sam, put those in the spreadsheet. Let's move on to transfers and captains. And please, guys, can we be quick on this? 

Julien Laurens [00:44:23]
Jules, quick, uh, quick. I think I might keep. Kudos. I know it's city, uh, at the London stadium, but I just might. I might give him this game. And then I say, so probably no changes. Uh, and just roll on the free. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:36]
Transfer and who you are. 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:38]
No changes. Again. 

Julien Laurens [00:44:39]
No. I had one with Livramento that was terrible. So I'm not going to do one this trust himself. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:44]
No. 

Julien Laurens [00:44:45]
Exactly why? And then probably, uh, isak as captain, because that's what he does against Perez. 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:53]
We can't be friends anymore. 

Julien Laurens [00:44:54]
Haaland also scores a lot against West Ham, too, so it could be Haaland. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:57]
Yeah, I think it's tough to go against Haaland when he's just done what he's done, isn't it, Sam? Are you gonna do that? 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:03]
Yeah. I mean, clearly I'm not gonna captain a player against my own team, am I? Um, so I'm gonna make a transfer this week. I'm gonna do NkU to Morgan Rogers this week. I think that makes us can't be not part of the Aston Villa fan club going into this week. I feel like I need to have a villa player in. I could actually go e sec to Watkins. I've got the money for that, but I don't really want to sell e sac this week. So Morgan Rogers is going to come in and captain Sea. Yeah, I think for me, it probably will be Harlan. He's got a great record, um, at West Ham. He scored three times there in his last two Premier League trips. So I'm probably going to go for him. I don't know. I do also quite fancy, um, quite fancy saka, but it's the early kick off and I don't like to captain someone in the early kick off, so probably Harlan. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:48]
Yeah. And Brighton have been really good at home as well, haven't they? Me, I think. I think Harland is obviously, if you had Watkins or Rogers, though, they could be an option, couldn't they, sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:55]
Um, yeah, they absolutely could. And I think you could go for a Fulham player as well. They look like decent options as well, if you wanted to go a bit more differential. But I think if. And also if you've got Cole Palmer in your team, I think he's a really nice captaincy pick this week. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:11]
Yeah. A reminder that Chelsea are playing in the second qualified match for the conference league on Thursday evening. We're recording this on Thursday morning. So a few things could have changed then, particularly in terms of what we said earlier with Chelsea too. Now, I've done this pod a bit backwards today. All the admin I'm meant to do at the top, we got distracted and we went off in a million different directions. So thank you. If you stayed with us this long. It's been. It's been a different podcast. An interesting podcast, hasn't it, Jules? 

Julien Laurens [00:46:33]
Very interesting. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:34]
Very fascinating. As interesting as I have been. So I'm going to do what I normally do at the beginning, at the end, in terms of reminding of the pod mini league code is q seven Y c o, the letter o zero. Um, and just a recap of who's doing well. Congratulations to Matthew. Bye. He is top. He got 93 points with his team fast and furious. Um, I'm wondering if he's regretting that team name now. He didn't use his triple captain, which is the most remarkable thing. But he did play his wild card into game week two. But he didn't actually play fast, despite naming his team after him. So he got seven points on the bench for the Leicester defender there in the world. So a really strong start for him. And also proof that if things aren't going well, it doesn't matter if you want to wild card early. Uh, wild carding after just one game week. Interestingly, we're seeing chips be used. Quite a lot of the top ten, eight managers played a chip, but none of them played the triple captain. There were four wild cards and four free hits. Matthew is two points ahead of James White and Ernie Ronnie, who were tied in second on 195 points. So, yeah, congratulations to everyone moving early on those chips and being very decisive, myself and, um, Jules, not so decisive and not. Not willing to use our chips early. Are we? Not a chance. 

Julien Laurens [00:47:52]
Not yet. 

Kelly Somers [00:47:53]
Um, okay, so, Jules, you're not making a transfer? 

Julien Laurens [00:47:56]
No. 

Sam Bonfield [00:47:56]
Very boring. 

Kelly Somers [00:47:57]
Nope. Don't trust yourself, Sam. You're making one transfer. I've already made my transfer this week. I have finally brought in Robinson because I just didn't have enough defenders. And mosquera is staying as my 3rd. 3rd sub. Uh, so he can stay away from my team. Wall street last night, typically. Okay, your deadline this week, 90 minutes ahead of Arsenal versus Brighton. It is 11:00 a.m. on Saturday. Guys, you still going to be on holiday when game week three gets underway? 

Sam Bonfield [00:48:20]
No, I'll be home. 

Julien Laurens [00:48:21]
I'll be home as well. Yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:23]
Okay, good. So you'll be paying full attention ahead of next week's podcast, but off the bench. We'll be back on Monday. Sam, you'll be joined by FPl Sonaldo. They'll be talking, talking you through all of the game. Week three, talking points. I'll be back on the fantasy show on Friday. I've got two guests in the studio with me this week. Az and Gianni will be with us. Thanks as always for listening. And sorry that this has been the most bonkers pod we've had all season. I hope you've been interested. I certainly have. See you later.
