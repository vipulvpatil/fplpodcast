Kelly Somers [00:00:01]
It's the penultimate pod before the season starts. A week on from our worries, we are all set on Holland. We're looking a lot at Liverpool. We have fun with the fixtures and Jules's Olympic practice continues. Hello. Welcome back to the FPL pod. Whether you're listening via podcast or watching us on YouTube, it's great to be back, gearing up for what is becoming a rapidly appearing around the corner FPL season. As always, Sam Bonfield and Julian Laurent are here. Sam is right now the busiest time in your whole year? 

Sam Bonfield [00:00:37]
Basically, yeah. 

Kelly Somers [00:00:38]
I was thinking about it, that your kids are off school, it's kids holidays and it's the start of FPL. I just think this must be like everything kind of crescendoing for you. 

Sam Bonfield [00:00:46]
Yeah, it'd be nice to go to bed at some point. That would be nice if we could get some sleep at some stage. That would be really nice. Yeah, it is. It's really busy and then the first match will kick off and then everything will settle down into a nice little routine. But, yeah, at the moment it is crazy busy. But I love that. That's the best bit. Really? 

Kelly Somers [00:01:02]
Yeah. And I like this bit because it's the anticipation, it's the belief that we can all still win fpl. In a couple of weeks, we'll all know we can't win fpl. Well, someone can, of course, but I don't think it'll be any of us. Jules, your swimming went down an absolute treat on YouTube. I've even got a couple of listeners actually saying that they went to. From listening to it on the podcast to going onto YouTube just because they had to see those masters. I thought it looked a bit more like you were drowning, but what have you got? 

Julien Laurens [00:01:28]
That's not true. And I clearly inspired the french team and Leon Marchand to win all his gold medals. You know, I was there all along, all the time. It was brilliant. And now I've got athletics tonight, for example. So at the end of the show, I will do a few of my athletics moves. 

Sam Bonfield [00:01:43]
Oh, goodness. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:44]
Can't wait to see which distance. 

Julien Laurens [00:01:45]
I'm a great athlete. I run fast, I jump high and far. Everything. 

Kelly Somers [00:01:50]
I questioned Kehin Daniel, who commented, saying that he came from the podcast to watch on YouTube, and he said I wasn't disappointed. Swims like a true olympian. 

Julien Laurens [00:01:59]
Thank you very much. Like a fish and water. Thank you. What's his name? 

Kelly Somers [00:02:03]
I can't quite work it out from his YouTube name, but his YouTube name is Kehind Daniel. I'm guessing his name is Daniel. Thanks for coming and giving us another view on YouTube. I've got to be honest, this whole YouTube thing is great, but it means, like, this morning, I'm just going to be honest because Jules will say if I don't. I was eating my breakfast just before we came on. Jules is saying, are you going to be on YouTube with your breakfast in your teeth? So the commitment we're showing to you guys, don't worry, there's no breakfast in my teeth. Thanks, Jules. Anyway, you are at the Olympics, which does include football, so have you been keeping across, firstly, the Olympics, football, and also preseason in general? 

Julien Laurens [00:02:38]
Exactly, Kelly. And we start with the Olympics, as you mentioned, because Jean Philippe Mateta has been an absolute star for France in the quarterfinal and semi final. He scored three goals in those two games. If you want to put him in your squad, no problem. The only thing is, he will very likely miss the start of the season because he will need a bit of holidays after this. We know, for example, that Alexander Lacazette and Lyon. Lyon expected him to play in the second game of the season. So for Mateta, he might be a bit similar, but he's on top form for sure. And the final is on Friday now. And there's also a lot of friendlies going on everywhere. Chelsea last night lost to Real Madrid, two one, but they played much better. And we saw another goal for Madoque. So that's two in two for him. Before that, they lost to Manchester City quite heavily, though. Four two after being 40 down, where we saw Erling Haaland with a hat trick. We saw another goal from Oscar Bob. Remember we mentioned him last week? Liverpool were really good in their two games against Arsenal. They won two one. Against Manchester United, they won 30. Javier, very good against Arsenal. Curtis Jones, very good against United. That's one to keep in mind. We saw Pedro Poro scoring again for spurs. Sorry, Sam. They lost to Bayern Munich. And also, let's not forget all the new signings in the Premier League, the likes of Smith Row and Fulcrug and Jorgensen and Somerville and all of that that we can mention later. 

Kelly Somers [00:03:56]
I gotta be honest, Sam said she's not sleeping. When the heck are you sleeping? 

Sam Bonfield [00:04:00]
Because. 

Julien Laurens [00:04:00]
No, but, like, you know, you can't watch everything buzzing from the Olympics, so then you struggle to sleep a little bit, so then you can watch a bit more football. There's always time for football, Sam, I. 

Kelly Somers [00:04:10]
Did think of you when Pedro Poirot scored, because I know he was kind of on your watch list. You're a Spurs fan as well. But what else has kind of made your ears prick up when you've been listening out what's been happening in preseason? 

Sam Bonfield [00:04:19]
There's a lot of rumors at the moment, aren't there? And I think it's difficult because obviously this point of the season, you hear a lot of transfer stuff going on and it's trying to work out whether because what you don't want to do is have a rumor that then ends up coming to something serious and you need to then find that the player that you've got in your team is the one that then misses out. But yeah, there's been a lot of kind of stuff happening in the press. We'll keep an eye on and see what happens over the coming weeks. But I think it was the Harlan goal that changed the whole FPL community, didn't it, really? Because there was lots of divisiveness in terms of who was having him, who wasn't having him, why you wouldn't have him, why you would have him. And the Chelsea fixture in game week one, the fact that it's away, I think, was putting a lot of people, it was their excuse, I think, to go without Harlan. And then, of course, he goes and bangs a hatchet against them in preseason. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:06]
Also, it goes back to what we said, what, this time last week, a week ago we were saying how quickly things can change in preseason, weren't we talking about his injury last week and being worried? And I think, Jules, you were the one that said to me, oh, don't be silly. Don't worry. 

Julien Laurens [00:05:17]
Let's see. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:18]
Yeah, it doesn't matter. And yeah, it's amazing how much can change in a week. Jules, what do you think his ownership is at the moment? 

Julien Laurens [00:05:24]
So I would say so. Last time was around 34%, wasn't it? Last week when we did the show? I suspect with the goals now and the fact that he looked. I mean, maybe he's still struggling a little bit with a niggle or two, like Pep said, but he looked pretty sharp to me, especially in that first half against Chelsea. So I would say maybe around the 45% now. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:44]
Not quite. It's 40.2% at the time of recording. This is on Wednesday morning when we're speaking. 

Julien Laurens [00:05:49]
But so still more managers without him than with him. 

Kelly Somers [00:05:52]
Yeah, but it is going up. We were expecting it to go up even more, I'm guessing. Jules, do you think? 

Julien Laurens [00:05:57]
Yeah, I mean, personally, as you know, I would not. Not have him. I think he's a massive risk. I know he's expensive, more than ever. And I know if you, if you decide to go with him, it means that you need to adapt the rest of your budget for the players that you might want. So we said, if you want Salah and Haaland, then it's difficult. If you don't have Haaland, you can have Salah and some really good players around him. So I get that. But I think it's a massive risk not to have Haaland because he's been on great form this summer. We said he had no international football in the summer at all, so he'd been able to go to Norway on holidays, do all the things that Norwegians do, you know, like cutting wood and stuff and fishing salmon, I guess, and, and obviously being ready and super sharp. 

Kelly Somers [00:06:43]
Now, what? Should we make a generalization at this point? 

Julien Laurens [00:06:46]
No, no, no. I'm just saying, on his instagram, he. 

Kelly Somers [00:06:48]
Said, I love Jonquils. You see him cutting, eat snails. 

Julien Laurens [00:06:51]
Yeah, no, no, I know. We do that, too. I'm just saying, you know, I went through his holiday on Instagram, on his Instagram. And that's a lot of things that he did. So that, I guess that's what people in Norway do. 

Kelly Somers [00:07:01]
Okay, disclaimer. I don't actually think that about french people, by the way, Sam. In general, it's an interesting trend, actually, isn't it? I know it's something that you've noticed as well. Managers don't quite seem to know what to do with the expensive assets. And it goes back to the whole point of the fact that the big premium players are priced. So interestingly, none of them are that highly owned at the moment. It seems like people are just kind of still not quite sure what to do. 

Sam Bonfield [00:07:23]
Yeah, and I think that's definitely the case. I was chatting to FPL focal Oscar at the beginning of the week, and we were talking about the game week one ownerships from last season and what they look like. And it's really fascinating because I think the game week one ownerships that we have currently, a lot of them are the auto picks. So, you know, when you just select a team quickly because you want to get a good team id and you auto pick your squad in, a lot of them that are still highly owned were in those auto pick teams. So I wonder if there's some managers that have auto picked and then haven't come back and fully set up their team for the season yet. That might change the ownership figures. But also when you look at last season heading into game week one now, by the time we hit game week two, Hanan's ownership was at 92%, but going into game week one, it was at 89%. So we are like half under half the ownership that he had last time around, which is also a bit mad. And then last year, there was only three other players that were owned really highly. So one of them was Saka, who was owned by 60% of the game. And then we had Astupanyan, who was owned by 54%, and Marcus Rashford, who was owned by 51%. And when you look at that in comparison to this season, we're seeing a lot more spread across the most popular players. And I think that's because people are either choosing to go without Salah or they're choosing to go without Haaland. And because of that, we're seeing like a number of players that are sitting in around the 40% to 50% ownership. So it'll be interesting to see how this season pans out, really. Because obviously, the higher the ownership, the more that's going to hurt you if you don't have them in your team. And there's more players to worry about this season that are going to be more heavily owned, although they won't have the explosive, absolutely catastrophic impact that not having Harlan would have had last season. So, yeah, fascinating. And I think the fact that it's Isak and Watkins and Cole Palmer that are leading the way in terms of the most heavily owned is interesting too, because they are significantly cheaper than our most premium players. 

Kelly Somers [00:09:16]
Okay, we're. What are we, about seven or eight minutes into this podcast? I think it's time we gave an update on our drafts. I found this week particularly scary because I've. Since last week's podcast, I can't get off my mind that I haven't got a Liverpool player. I can't get my Salah off my mind, but more worryingly, I can't get him into my team. So at the moment I don't have him. But I know that I'm probably going to need to find a way. So over the next week, I'm going to kind of be downgrading and playing around to try and get him in. So I'm not going to go first because as I've just said, my team's in flux. Jules, do you want to tell us where your team's at? 

Julien Laurens [00:09:49]
Yeah, I've got only one change compared to the squad that we mentioned last week, and that's Harvey Elliott. I think he's been outstanding in this pre season with Liverpool. I know there's a lot of players in this Liverpool squad for Arnislott to pick for the midfield three and you just don't know right now. Nobody knows. McAlister has just come back from his holidays. We saw Sobos light starting against Arsenal, but then Graven Burch started against United. But Jones and Elliot were both starting in those two games. And I thought Elliot, especially against Arsenal was outstanding and already last season we saw how good he was in very different positions, slightly different style of football on the club than what we will see on the slots. So for me he will start the season. I'm pretty certain that he will start as a start of the season for Liverpool and he looked in great form and he's at 5.5 million is still much cheaper than a lot of the other options that you might have in midfield. So I was like you, Kelly, I didn't really have. I was thinking about Darwin and had Darwin in, but Darwin is a bit in and out. Really. 

Kelly Somers [00:10:46]
Have you still got. You have Darwin. 

Julien Laurens [00:10:48]
But I was going to come to Darwin because I really want Nicholas full crook. So I'm just waiting to see how much he will cost. But right now you can't. You don't know he's not in the game. 

Kelly Somers [00:10:58]
You're that excited about him already, George? 

Julien Laurens [00:11:00]
Yeah, because I think. Because I think unless he's like, what. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:02]
Would you need him to be to get him in your team? 

Julien Laurens [00:11:04]
I don't know. So I understand that he's a german international Champions League finalist also. He's not. It's just not. It's not like me going into the game and, you know, costing 4 million, I get that, but he's also. He's also unproven in the Premier League. He's also quite old now and so there's a few, there's a pros and cons, no doubt. So I would hope for a decent price and then I think I will bring him in because what West Ham are building, certainly attacking wise with Somerville, imagine a full krug then below him, behind him Bowen. Kudos, Somerville. And then even Paqueta behind that with Alvarez with full backs, that could be decent. MSN is a great crossover of the ball. I think Fulcrut could have an absolute blast in the Premier League this season for West Ham. So I would bring him in if he's not too expensive, for sure. 

Kelly Somers [00:11:56]
To be fair, one player that I won't have come to start the season will be havet. I've got rid of him and I've brought him Watkins at the moment. But I can't afford to have Watkins, Haaland. And who's my third striker? Isak, of course, and Salah. So I'll probably have to. I'm not saying I'll look there, Jules, but I'm looking for a third strike. 

Julien Laurens [00:12:13]
You should look there. I think full crook could be a great choice. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:16]
I think Elliot's a very interesting choice as well. Because you're committed to going with no Salah, aren't you? 

Julien Laurens [00:12:21]
Yeah, I just. I would love him, but I can't. 

Kelly Somers [00:12:23]
Afford him, so just scares me starting without him. Sam still got Saarland. That's what I'm going to start calling them. I didn't even do that on purpose. I just can't speak. Have you still got Salah and Harlandhouse? 

Sam Bonfield [00:12:36]
Yes. Yeah. And the more, the closer that the season draws, the more I'm certain that that's what I'm gonna do. So I do have, in my planner, I do have two drafts, the one that has Salah, which is the one that I'm currently on in the main app. And then I also have another one that has jota instead of Salah. But I am pretty sad, I think, on the Salah draft, that's the one that I'm constantly tinkering with. That's the one where I'm constantly moving players in and out. I just think that there's so many nice options in the cheaper price points that you can utilise to have, to have Salah that I want to start with both of them. 

Kelly Somers [00:13:17]
Okay. How's the rest of your team looking? 

Sam Bonfield [00:13:20]
I think I'm stabilizing now, to be honest. I'm making fewer changes every week. I've changed Gehy out for Anderson because I just wanted to have the security of game week one and then moving into the season knowing that he's going to be there. Whereas Gehy obviously really late coming back from international football with England. And the fact that Kuliszewski is still playing in the number nine has meant that I've swapped Brandon Johnson out for him. Because unless spurs do sign a number nine in the next couple of weeks, it looks like Kudicevsky is going to start there. So if he's going to start as an out of position number nine for spurs, then I'm going to go with him to start the season. His relationship with Sunny has been really nice. The link up play between the two of them, they're constantly changing positions from the left and into the centre. So at the moment I've done that. Everything else is pretty much as it was last time. The team, if I don't go for Sal, obviously changes dramatically, but I just can't see me using that other draft. 

Kelly Somers [00:14:16]
Okay, just in case, this is the first podcast people have listened to this season. Firstly, where have you been? Secondly, we'll let you off because it has been holidays and the off season you've probably been watching the Olympics, but let's just run through your full team, Jules, because people might not know who you had him before. 

Julien Laurens [00:14:29]
Yeah. So Fleck and Areola in goal. Then in defence, Pedro Poirot, Valentin, Barco, Saliba, Konsa and Davis, obviously the GoAt, are Ipswich. Then in midfield, Saka, Kudos. Gordon Elliot. Now instead of Nkunku and Oscar Bob. That gave me, by the way, 1 million in the bank. You said keep money in the bank. So here we go. And then up front right now, Darwin, Haaland and Isak. But full crook potentially being able to come in at some point for Darwin. 

Kelly Somers [00:14:59]
Okay, go on then, Sam. 

Sam Bonfield [00:15:01]
So Rhea and Turner in goal, Vardiol, Anderson, Konza, Howard, Bellis and Davis. And then in midfield, Salah, eze. Kulisiewski in Kunku and winks up top, Haaland, Isak and Muniz. 

Kelly Somers [00:15:15]
Okay, this is where I'm at, but as I said, mine is very, very changeable. Flecken and Arreola in goal. My defence is Konza, Barso, gehide, vardiol, Taylor. You may notice that I've got rid of. I haven't got an Arsenal defender in there at the moment. That's also what I would somehow like to get in, but trying to get Salah into a team and also when I've brought in vardio, I've now got to upgrade to get another 6 million defender. Not sure how I'm going to do that. Saka and Kunku. And Kunku's going to go eza. I'm going to have to downgrade him to a 6.5 winx. And Gordon, Isaac, Haaland and Watkins. So yeah, lots to be done with my team. Lots of decisions to be made, as I'm sure it is for everyone listening as well. Okay then let's pick up where we left off the conversation last week because I'm very aware that we've over chatted so far a lot on this pod and not got through all of the things that we wanted to. But we did talk about fixture runs and how the fact that you can roll your transfers up to five transfers for this season. We're probably going to want to save them. Up and use them to kind of have a bit of a mini wild card, so to speak. And we can also target fixture runs. Sam, run us through the opening six weeks of fixtures sorted by difficulty and who you think has the nicest run of fixtures should be targeting. 

Sam Bonfield [00:16:25]
So Fulham sit top of the fixture ticker for the opening six game weeks. Really nice opening block of fixtures. Or it's Manchester United in the opening game on Friday evening next week. But then after that Leicester, Ipswich, West Ham, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest. So a nice one of fixtures for them could easily result in clean sheets because we know historically they've been good at that even when they don't keep a clean sheet. Leno does tend to pick up additional points as well. So if you do want to go for a goalkeeper, he looks like a really nice pick. And particularly after six weeks, that's when people tend to start wanting to think about wild cards. If you can target in on teams that have got nice runs up until that point, that puts you in a nice position. So Fulham looking like decent options and then it's Liverpool next. Which is why the Salah conversation is so interesting because they've obviously got Ipswich on the opening weekend of the season. And then after that the fixture run continues to be nice with Brentford, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth and Wolves. There should be plenty of goals in there for Liverpool managers like you guys who don't start the season with Salah unless you've picked the right other Liverpool player. And there will be other Liverpool players that you can go with, whether it's a Darwin or a Jota or Harvey Elliott or whoever it is, the Bosley you might be then struggling to find a way to get them in. So I think looking for a Liverpool player makes a lot of sense. And then Crystal palace are right up there as well. So you can see why the defensive players and Eze are proving really popular at palace because really nice block of fixtures for them. It's only really the Chelsea game in game week three for them. That looks really difficult in those opening fixtures. But then if Chelsea's form doesn't improve, as we've seen in preseason, they've not been great. Maybe that game's not as difficult as it looks on the ticker. 

Kelly Somers [00:18:04]
Fulham are interesting. You mentioned Smith Rojels. He's very much on my radar now. 

Julien Laurens [00:18:09]
Yeah, he had a good debut the other day. He's corn as well. I think he looked very excited to be able to play after. I think what we could describe are two very frustrating seasons between the injuries and the lack of game time really for someone who has clearly showed before in the past that he was really good suddenly with a great potential. So his 5.5 million again in that bracket, slightly less than some of the other in that 6.5 bracket, he's right now owned by 4.4% of the managers. Which means, Kelly, that four point something ownership that a lot of people like you have not just thinking about him but already thought he could be a good differential at that price. You don't take much risk really. 5.5, you go for it. If you want to leave him on your bench, you can. But 4% for somebody who's just changed clubs because nobody would have had him before when he was still an Arsenal player. So it's because I think a lot of people believe he can have a good impact in that Fulham team like as we've been saying, has really good fixture coming, starting the season with and then I going forwards. He might bring something a little bit different. Him and Mooney's some of those attacking fluidity. So I think it's an interesting conversation. 

Kelly Somers [00:19:21]
It's an interesting conversation, but I don't think I would actually be bold enough to go there. 

Julien Laurens [00:19:25]
Who's your worst midfielder? 

Kelly Somers [00:19:27]
Harry winks. But he's a million cheaper. 

Julien Laurens [00:19:30]
Okay. 

Kelly Somers [00:19:30]
And he's only going to sit on my bench, so. And that million, as with Tort's back. 

Julien Laurens [00:19:33]
I can see why people are tempted by five points. 

Kelly Somers [00:19:35]
Yeah. Oh no, don't get me wrong. If all of a sudden, if I did commit to not going with Salah all of a sudden I probably would quite like to upgrade a Harry Winks to an Emile Smith row. If they. 

Sam Bonfield [00:19:42]
There's no way you're not going to go with Salah. Like really, there's just no way this is not happening. 

Kelly Somers [00:19:48]
But no, you're probably right, but no, but seeing the Liverpool fixtures and that's why I think it was so important to get into the fixture runs this week. We've mentioned Fulham, the fact that Liverpool are second. They're the only in the top four teams. Fulham, Liverpool, Crystal Palace, Southampton, Liverpool. There stand out going into game week one without a Liverpool player. 

Julien Laurens [00:20:09]
Yeah, but it doesn't have to be Salah, though. Don't forget this is not Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool anymore. This is not based and built all around Mo Salah anymore. It's not like that. And we've seen. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:21]
So is Harvey Elliott the best option? 

Julien Laurens [00:20:23]
No, no, no. I think the best option is the option that you want. So yeah, it could be Salah. 

Kelly Somers [00:20:27]
And for Sam, Salah is the best option. 

Julien Laurens [00:20:29]
Sorry, I just think that this is going to be a different Liverpool and Salah might still be at the end the best player in that team and the most efficient and the top goal scorer and the top. Anything you want, maybe. I'm just saying. Belak for the Cole Palmer discussion that we had last week and the week before, it's a different manager. This Chelsea team is not going to be built around Palmer like Pochettino did. Just give him the ball and he's going to do his thing this one again. In the end, Palmer might still have a great season but it will be different. And this Liverpool team will be different too, obviously. I'm just saying that, yes, if you can have Salah and you really want Salah, go for him. But there's other options that can also be very good under Arnold slot from Darwin to Luis Diaz to Jones and Sobos, Lai and Elliott in midfield to a defender. Maybe Trent will have a great season because slot will rely heavily on him on the right hand side. There's a lot of things again. So I know we all want Salah, but we can't all have Salah to start with. And two, I don't think he'll be the end of the world because I do believe that it will be a different Liverpool team and certainly nothing too centered around him like we used to see before on the club. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:35]
I think what also scares me, it's the question that I think I asked Sam in the last podcast, the one before, where at this stage of the season, it's about playing it safe, isn't it? Because can you imagine if Salah gets a hat trick on the opening day, you've captained him, you're already however many points behind. That's, I think, what scares me. And it's harder to get to him than it is to get away from him. 

Julien Laurens [00:21:53]
No, very true. 

Kelly Somers [00:21:55]
Sam, you're sitting there kind of. 

Julien Laurens [00:21:57]
I mean, she doesn't know the issue, obviously. Look, she's so smug in the way she looks at us. 

Kelly Somers [00:22:01]
I don't think she is because I think she was accepting people on YouTube be able to see. Sam was very accepting of everything Jules was saying. 

Julien Laurens [00:22:06]
She wasn't. She was looking. 

Kelly Somers [00:22:07]
Yeah, she wasn't this, but I was just waiting for her to go. 

Sam Bonfield [00:22:10]
But Jules, I fully agree with everything you've just said. Like, and I've had drafts of my team where I've had Subozli in there. I've got a draft that I've got Jota in instead I've got. 

Kelly Somers [00:22:20]
Is that the problem though Sam, that we don't know which other player to go to whereas it feels that Salah is safe because I would love to go for Jota. I've had some great times. Not literally with Jota but you know what I mean. Like having Jota in my team. Having jotter in my team. Jota such a fun player to own but it feels like with players like him you have to own them at the right time. You have to get on and off often at the right time. Whereas Salah don't really get on and off as much. Yeah, it's streaky. That's the. Yeah. 

Sam Bonfield [00:22:46]
I just think that what you said at the end there Kelly for me is the key. It's there. There will be another Liverpool player or two or three that end up being decent options for much, much cheaper price than Salah is. But I don't yet know who they are. We've not seen the consistency of starts yet because slots tenure at Liverpool has started with half of his players disappearing for masses of time on their international duties and only just coming back. So hes only had Jota for a couple of matches so far. Darwins only just back. Hes only just getting Gagpo back. Theres a lot of players that hes still got to use and theyve only got one pre season match left to go. So understanding the best team and how hes going to set up for that Ipswich game feels difficult. So in my head I know I want Liverpool because they're sitting high on the fixture ticker. I'm expecting them to have a good season. I'm expecting them to be very attacking. So I want to have invested in them particularly for this run of fixtures. At the beginning the only player I feel really secure about investing in is Salah. And so because of that my thinking is well I'll have Salah for the beginning knowing that I can get any other Liverpool player if I've gone to Salah. And it's relatively easy because I can just swap Salah for Jota. Swap Salah for. I mean if it's Harvey Elliott then even better because the budget is absolutely massive then to spend elsewhere. And I would rather have that position than have a subozle in my team. And then Salah kicks off in game week one gets a hat trick and looks phenomenal and then I'm trying to find the budget to get Subozle up to Salah. That's much harder than coming the other way. So in my mind I like to have the most expensive player possible if they're from a team that I really know I want to invest in because it's so easy to move him afterwards. But it's so much more difficult to try and go the other way unless you leave 6 million in the bank. And if you're going to do that, what's the point? You might as well just have them. 

Kelly Somers [00:24:37]
In the first place, I tell you then let's rank Liverpool players. So we all agree that Salah is number one. Who would be the second best Liverpool pick? Jules? 

Julien Laurens [00:24:47]
That's a good question. I mean fee and all were really good defensively on the slot because they were also in the league where they had a lot of the ball and they were just so good at putting the opposition team under pressure and pressing them that there's a lot of teams in the area divisio against Feynard who hardly attacked anywhere. So you could go for Alisson because you could anticipate that Liverpool will be still very strong defensively on the slot because that's also what he does. If you don't believe that or if you believe. Okay, the Premier League is such a. Is the best league in the world. So it's so different to what maybe he could have done defensively in the Netherlands. I completely understand. Let's forget about Alisson. But I think Alisson could well be there. And when you see the fixtures you can easily see Liverpool keeping maybe five clean sheet out of those first six games easily. So maybe defensively there's a reflection to have where maybe you can go for Alisson or you can go for one of the defenders. And it's again difficult because Konate was on holidays. Trent has been on holidays again to go back to Sam's. Very good point. We're still not sure really what team is going to start that first game against Ipswich apart from a few names there and there. So if you just look at the starters Salah will start guaranteed. Elliott and Jones for me are going to start. And probably so was Lai. Very likely so was lie to it. So the midfield three would be there and then Jota started the last two games. I see no reasons why Jota would not start the next friendly which is the last one. And then that first Ipswich. The first game of the Premier League against Ipswich. So I would say after Salah, personally I would go for Elliott as the. 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:19]
Most important Sam jota. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:23]
Okay. 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:23]
I think so. I just. I think he'll probably play up top in that first game. I agree. 

Kelly Somers [00:26:30]
Okay. So yeah, we've kind of discussed a bit of Fulham, bit of Liverpool. Crystal palace are interesting though, aren't they, Sam? I think that's why we're seeing Ezra picked in so many drafts. Like I said, he's 7 million. So for me he might have to go as part of my sacrifice to get Salah in. I don't want him to go, but go on, tell me why I shouldn't get rid of him. 

Sam Bonfield [00:26:53]
I wouldn't want to get rid of him. The fixtures are really nice. With Elise gone, would expect him to kind of step up and take a more talismanic approach to that team. And I think, you know, we've seen that in Crystal palace teams in seasons gone by, haven't we? First with Zaha and now probably with Eze. The only negative I think, is the fact that Metesta is off at the Olympics still and obviously isn't likely to be around for game week one off a little bit. But those fixtures are nice. Far beyond the Crystal palace opening game where we may or may not have Mateta back. So I think for me he's a player that he's been in every draft and I have pretty much locked him in and I can't see any reason not to have him. And I think it's 7 million. He feels like a bit of a bargain as well because you've got to pay an extra 0.5 to have Mateta in your team over him. So yeah, I'd like to sit here, kells, and say, oh yeah, you can definitely go with that. But in my view, I think he's one of the players that feels pretty key to have. 

Kelly Somers [00:27:52]
Might be poor Anthony Gordon. That goes then, poor lad. The tough euro's not playing much and now he's not going to make it into my team. Jules, have you got any palace? 

Julien Laurens [00:28:00]
No, I don't. I was looking at my La Salle last night because I know your favorite, your boy from Watford. 

Kelly Somers [00:28:08]
Because the one thing I would say Jules though is with him is when he's good. He is so good. You may remember when Watford beat Liverpool the season they went down, the season Liverpool won the league. He's the best player he could play for a top, top Premier League club, but he's in and out. And I would wait a little while to see how he settles. 

Julien Laurens [00:28:26]
I was just saying that he's the one who's replacing Olise, you know, on the pitch, same position, different player, obviously, you know, right foot against left foot, etcetera, blah blah blah. But he's the one that they chose to replace Olise after his departure. And yeah, you're right, he's very inconsistent. But we've seen that before with Olisse, Matata and Eze, to be fair, until they hit this incredible run of form at the end of last season where there was just all of them, especially Olisse and Mateta walking on water. So if you're tempted by palace and you can't afford, for example, 7 million for Eze or 7.5 for Mateta, they sa there at 6 million. I mean, there's Jordan Iu too, if you want as a, the player that is there somewhere an enabler in your squad that will get some minutes because he's a decent player. So there's other options than just Eze and Matta. But I agree with you, Eze, especially because Matata, we don't know when he's going to be back with Eze. You know he's going to start the season and you know that a lot of what this team is going to do with the ball going forward will be around him or built around him. 

Kelly Somers [00:29:30]
So Palace's fixtures are Brentford, West Ham, then Chelsea, Leicester, Man United, Everton. Do you see quite a few clean sheets as well? Sam, you've gone for Anderson. I've currently got Gehe, but that will probably change. 

Sam Bonfield [00:29:40]
Yeah, I had Gehe in all of my picks until this week and I've swapped over to Anderson just because of the late return for Gehe. And I think I just really like those fixtures. I think there's definitely potential for clean sheets in there. Crystal palace were solid at the back end of last season, so I'm expecting some clean sheets. There are also some tough fixtures where I could see like, you know, we've spoken about West Ham and the signings that they've made. I could easily see them scoring in that one. But I think those openings fixtures look like there should be some clean sheets in there for palace. And you know, we see some attacking threat from players like Anderson as well. So I think had we had things like clearances, blocks and interceptions getting us a fancy points this season, then Gehe would have been the obvious choice. But when you're looking at the palace team, the more attacking one of those two is Anderson. And obviously if you can afford a little bit more than you up to on Munoz, and Munoz is a good shot as well. 

Julien Laurens [00:30:30]
5 million. Really good. Yeah. You need five? 

Kelly Somers [00:30:33]
Yeah, yeah. And something else that you've taken a look at, Sam, is the best fixture runs per club between game week one and 19, which is of course the final game week of this calendar year. If we're going to separate the season into, into two halves, why is this so important? How does this help you when you're planning your team? 

Sam Bonfield [00:30:51]
So I think when you first look at the fixture ticker, it can feel a bit overwhelming sometimes because obviously you've got 20 teams and 38 sets of fixtures and it is just kind of a mosaic of colors, I suppose. And it's quite difficult to then look at where things go. So one of the things I like to do is chunk it down to Christmas and the end of this calendar year. So I'm just looking at the opening set of 19 fixtures because after that we get our second wild card anyway. So if things massively change, you just wild card at that point. So once I've got it to 19 fixtures, then I like to look for blocks of really nice fixtures for each club because then I know in the back of my head that, you know, Arsenal have got a really nice fixture on, for example, between game week twelve and game week 19. So at that point I want to make sure that I'm heavily invested in the red side of north London and knowing that means that I can then start to think about how I might set up my team at different stages of this season. And I think that's even more important than ever with the fact that we can roll these five transfers now because it's putting us in a position where we can say, okay, I'm going to need to be three Arsenal players by game week twelve. How am I going to make sure that I've got the ability to get there? Because with an Arsenal player it's not so easy to get them because of their price points. You're going to have to really think about and maybe move budget between positions. And so knowing that I want three Arsenal by the time I hit game week twelve is important. And there are some other fixtures, particularly when you're looking at enablers that you want to look at. Where are the nice fixture runs? Well, palace, who we've just been speaking about, for example, their fixture run, that's really nice runs from game week one all the way through to game week 14. And yes, there are a couple of matches in there that are difficult. There's a game against Villa, for example, and there's a game against Liverpool. But fundamentally, if you've got a 4.5 rotating defender from palace, you know that you've got them right the way through to 14 and you don't have to do anything about it. So that's for me, the reason why I like to chunk it up and just look at each team individually, where's their nice block and how do I want to invest by that point so that I can start to have some plans? Of course those plans change because form and all of that stuff, injuries, but knowing roughly where they come sometimes also makes it easier if you've got to leave a player out that you really want. So, like, I really want to have an arsenal defender and apart from rare, I just can't. So knowing that I don't have to have one necessarily until we hit game week twelve maybe makes me feel a little bit better about the decision not to have them from the start of the season when they sit quite low on the ticker. 

Kelly Somers [00:33:23]
Jules, I'm sure you've been looking at this much. 

Julien Laurens [00:33:25]
That's what I do every summer for the last ten years, I've done those blocks of fixtures, you know, so I know when to. When to change my stuff. So this is. This is really nothing new to me, obviously. 

Kelly Somers [00:33:40]
Should we move on? 

Julien Laurens [00:33:41]
Should we move on? The only thing I would say the sample. Thank you very much, Sam. This is really helpful. No, it's really helpful for everyone. It's a shame that none of the listeners will ever have this under their eyes, but we do. So it's good. No, I'm kidding. We will keep updating people. There's Aston Villa there and between game week three and nine, really good. Don't forget as well that for a team like Villa, for example, Champions League is going to kick on. Champions League will start pretty much around that game week three. There's international break really early in September 2, and then after that it's the Champions League. And as we saw with Brighton, for example, last season in the Europa League, which they really struggled to deal with, the two competitions, the Thursday Sunday schedule, there was injuries, it was all new to them. I think there was a lot of excitement. They would be the same for Villa, and Villa might go better and they have more depth in their squad. All of that, of course. And Unai Emery is certainly more used to playing in Europe than de Zerbe was last season with Brighton. So it's a different context. However, when you look at the future and those block of fixtures and when you beat your squad, don't forget that for the big boys, there's no problem. They're used to it. But for a team like Villa, where this is all new, it might just bring something a little bit different. That might mean that when they play in Europe, they already started and three days later in the Premier League it's not the same. So just keep that in mind when you build your squad. 

Kelly Somers [00:35:00]
When you look at if we go back to the opening six weeks of the fixtures sorted by difficulty, Wolves are at the bottom, then Brentford, then interestingly, Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham all have difficult runs. Does that come into our thinking or are they completely fixed? Jabri some. 

Sam Bonfield [00:35:15]
Well, and I think this is where the fixture ticker. You have to kind of use your judgment on because Arsenal, Man City and Spurs being right down the bottom there, it's massively skewed by the fact that they obviously have games against each other. So you've got a north London derby in there, you've got Arsenal playing Man City in there and of course as soon as you add a red fixture to the ticker it pushes them right down so you can have really nice fixtures in and around it. But the fact that you've got one or two matches that are difficult in that block of time is going to see them sit lower. So with Arsenal for example, obviously there's games in there against Wolf, Brighton and Leicester as well as those two difficult fixtures against spurs and Man City. And actually there's a game against Villa in there as well. So I think just because they've got difficult fixtures doesn't mean they're not going to score goals. So you've got a saka in there, no problem really, is it? And I think it's the same with attacking players from all of those sides. Maybe it's more of a challenge with the defensive ones because is there likely to be a clean sheet in the game between Arsenal and Man City? Maybe not. Is there likely to be a clean sheet in the north London derby? Maybe not. But if you've got a poirot or, you know, Gabrielle or a vardiol they're just as likely to get an attacking return. So yeah, I think those sorts of teams, you have to look at the ticker, work out how many you invest in. But it wouldn't put me off investing altogether for sure. 

Kelly Somers [00:36:34]
Okay, so we've got just over a week to go until the start of season. So I think we're all, especially if you're me, because you're going to know your team's miles away from where you want it to be. You're going to kind of be going through each position working out who the best picks are. So we're going to go through each position now and say who we currently think the best picks are because we've heard Jules mention the likes of Annalisen as a good option for a goalkeeper. Maybe he'll pick him overall. Jules, let's start with. With keepers who are the best options. Also you do have to bear in mind budget as well. 

Julien Laurens [00:37:02]
So I would go for Leno because as we've been saying, Fulham have a really good fixture list to start the season. And then if I can have another one, it's Raya. I just think Arsenal will be again the best defence in the league. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:12]
Okay, Leno and Rhea. Sam for you. 

Sam Bonfield [00:37:14]
Yeah, I had both of those two on my list. I think if you want a budget then Leno's really nice. And I think if you've got the budget to spend on a premium one, then Reya. But I also think a shout out to Dean Henderson in Crystal Palace. I think he could be a really nice goalkeeper option. If you don't want to go for a Crystal palace defender, I don't think I'd double up. But if you don't want a Crystal palace defender because you've got a different set of rotating players, then go for Henderson. Ingle. 

Kelly Somers [00:37:40]
Of course, you do need a little bit more money. So at the moment, Jules, you and I are both on Flecken and Arreola, for example, two 4.5 keepers, Leno's 5 million, Reyes 5.5. So you'd have to find a whole 1.5 million if you were going to get to them. And that's kind of one of the perils of being an FPL manager, having to kind of try and spread out that budget and make your decisions. So, yeah, often goalkeepers are where we often kind of shave off some money, aren't they? Would you say that you've got the two? Are you happy with those two as your best two 4.5 skills? 

Julien Laurens [00:38:10]
Yeah, I think so. If I try to go for Leno, then you need just a 4 million goalkeeper that's never going to play, which I don't really like to do. And if you look at, as we said, brentford have tough fixtures and West Ham have quite difficult ones too, but it looks like they could alternate quite well. And when one has a really tough game, the other one is a more decent game. So I think Flaken and Arrowh could be a good pair. 

Kelly Somers [00:38:36]
Okay, defenders then. Best picks, Sam? 

Sam Bonfield [00:38:40]
Well, again, it's going to depend, isn't it, slightly on how much budget that you've got? I think going for vardial would be my choice in terms of the premium defenders and then your pick of Saliba or Gabrielle, whoever you prefer if, if you're struggling for budget then I'm massively coming around to the idea of Michelenko at the back as well. Like I think he's been very. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:01]
I'm pretty sure that. Or was it Branthwaite when I mentioned Neverton defender the other week I got. 

Sam Bonfield [00:39:07]
Yeah, yeah you did. Because I think I'm not shot down. I'm not hugely keen on spending a lot of money on Branthwaite or Pickford because I think that there are better players in their price point. But I'm coming around to the idea of Michelin Co at four and a half. I think the fixtures are nice for Everton. And defensively, Sean Deiss teams usually are good defensively. And so I'm sort of coming around to the idea of him. I've got Anderson in there as well. And obviously my favourite in Davis. I think he's a really, really nice budget enabler. And after those first two weeks, which his fixtures are nice, got Poirot and Munoz as my mid priced picks. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:42]
Okay, Jules. 

Julien Laurens [00:39:46]
Obviously best player in the world, best defender in the world. And then Vargio last. Guardiol is the overall pick, regardless of budget. Guardiol is the outstanding defender. Really behind Saliba after Saliba. 

Kelly Somers [00:39:58]
Yeah, I agree. I definitely. Is he behind Saliba? 

Julien Laurens [00:40:01]
Yeah. Come on, let's be, come on, let's be serious here. 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:03]
Behind Saliba, Sam, if you can only. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:05]
Have one of them. 

Julien Laurens [00:40:06]
Come on. Paris born and bred, Saliba is just everything more than Gwajan. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:12]
Sam. You don't support either team. Who's the best pick of those two? If you can only go for one? 

Sam Bonfield [00:40:17]
Look, I love Saliba. I had him for every single game week last season and I hate the idea of my team without him. Every time I look at it I'm like, doesn't have Saliba. However, I just think that vardial's attacking threat puts him above Saliba. In terms of FPL picks, I'm not saying in terms of like footballing ability or who's the best player, but in terms of FPL picks, I think Vardiol just top sleeper, just on the attacking threat that he brings. 

Kelly Somers [00:40:45]
Okay, I'm gonna not let Jules have a reply. I'm doing that thing again when we're at the end of the podcast. That's good. You're saving me time. We're at the end of the podcast, I'm gonna get in trouble for not moving it on. So best midfielders who went first last time sounded Jules. 

Julien Laurens [00:41:00]
I think it's difficult because it depends a lot of what kind of player you like and what style you want. So. Salah. Yes, of course, Salah. Outstanding. No problem. I went for Foden, though, because I do think that last season was such an incredible one from a. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:13]
Can he do it again? 

Julien Laurens [00:41:14]
Exactly. I think so. And I think this season would be the confirmation of that. But again, he had the euros where he did. Okay, let's put it that way, to be kind to him. So that means, you know, delayed when he comes back for preseason, which was obviously not the case last. 

Kelly Somers [00:41:31]
Jules, with his euros, though. Did you not think so? There was one point, I think it was in the semi final where I sat there and I realised he'd had one ruled out for VAR. He'd had one off the line, he'd hit the. He pulled in one game, there was a fantastic save, and he'd also hit the bar. He was still creating and he was still looking for goal in a team that was at times struggling well throughout, pretty much struggling to create opportunities. So he still had a pretty good roast, didn't he? I suppose in terms of considering what was going on around him, he was. 

Julien Laurens [00:42:00]
Not probably put in the best position and environment either. So I think Foden for me, because he's cheaper than Salah, because he's still. I can't believe he's the same price as Palmer. Pretty much where they for me, he's way ahead of Palmer in his own development and his own level. And yes, he's a bit older, but still. So, yeah, I would have Foden even ahead of Salah. 

Kelly Somers [00:42:23]
Are we all agreeing now? You mentioned Palmer there. We haven't really mentioned him from the first podcast. Are we all agreeing that Palmer is now at his price point with that big price hike? I think we all had him on the first podcast, didn't we? None of us do now, Sam, are we all agreeing? Can't afford him. He's one of the sacrifices that we're having to make. 

Sam Bonfield [00:42:39]
Yeah. I've not had him in a single draft yet because I think he's too expensive. And I think at ten and a half, I just think that the way that Chelsea will play this season will be different. I don't think he's going to have this, like, give the ball to Palmer and off you go and do whatever you like stuff that we saw last season. I think we'll have a bit more certainty in where the Chelsea players play and a bit more structure. And that may or may not be good for. For Palmer and for his ability to get FPR points and I just think for ten and a half million, he's a million more than Foden. That's significantly more, you know, in terms of the way that you spend the rest of your budget. He's more than sun and he's had a fantastic preseason. He's more than Saka, who I would expect to have another great season at Arsenal. So, yeah, for me, when you can have Nkunku for 5 million or 4 million rather less, that's. I just can't justify Palmer then, who. 

Kelly Somers [00:43:30]
Are your best midfielders? 

Sam Bonfield [00:43:32]
I've got Salah obviously as the premium pick and I put sunny up there too, because he's been having a really nice preseason for spurs. In the middle. I've got Eze, who I just think is a bit of a kind of no brainer really, for his price point. And then I've put Madison in there alongside Kulisiewski. Madison, if we'd have had the bonus point system for this season, last season, Madison is the player who would have benefited the most and would have got more bonus points as a result of it, even though he missed chunks of last season through injury. So with the way that he plays, he will win fouls, he will have shots on target, he will take set pieces. All of this stuff is going to be beneficial in the bonus point system. So if you are trying to play that as a system, then he could be a nice option. And then just a little shout out to Jacob Murphy, who has been phenomenal in preseason. He's had seven goal involvements so far and he's five and a half. So if you are looking for a cheap option, maybe he's there. Rogers has also had a really good preseason at Aston Villa and again in that sort of same price point. And then, God love him, Harry Winks is coming up again. Because I think if you are going for a system where you want Harry. 

Julien Laurens [00:44:42]
Winks in the best midfield option, I mean, this has to stop, this Harry Winks loving Jules. 

Sam Bonfield [00:44:47]
But the thing is, it depends upon how you're defining best, doesn't it? So best in terms of the most likely to return points or best in terms of. 

Kelly Somers [00:44:57]
I should have. I should have done a criteria here. I should have maybe said best premium, best mid price. I don't think Sam is saying Harry was in the best five midfielders in the league. 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:10]
Well, no, because we've had. Because we've had Davis and those guys. 

Julien Laurens [00:45:13]
Because you mentioned five defenders, but we were going to agree, like Salibagvargiol, Foden. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:18]
Is stickler for the rules, isn't he? 

Julien Laurens [00:45:20]
And maybe Harry Winks, you know, Harry Wings great player. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:23]
But maybe you need Harry Winks to. 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:24]
Have all of these other players. That's the point, isn't it, is that, you know, you want Salah and Vardian and Saliba and all of these other guys that we want to have in our teams, then you need somebody that you can rely on and is cheap and nice enabling. So that's why is that. 

Julien Laurens [00:45:38]
That is very true. I was only kidding. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:40]
Oh, this is nice for us to end. Almost end. The podcast on agreement. Doesn't happen very often. Never was, though. Can't forget those. I think we're all set. Set on Harland and ESAC. Correct. In terms of them being the best. 

Julien Laurens [00:45:50]
Yeah. And also Stuart, I suppose. I think Stewart, 4.5 million, you know, great to have. 

Kelly Somers [00:45:57]
All right. 

Sam Bonfield [00:45:58]
He's not going to play. There's a big difference between him and Harry wins. How can I find the cheapest forward? 

Kelly Somers [00:46:06]
I could see him doing something. He's opened his app and he's gone on 4.5. 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:10]
Wait a minute, I'll start French. 

Kelly Somers [00:46:11]
If you are not taking this podcast seriously, Julie and Lauren, we'll get someone else on next week. 

Sam Bonfield [00:46:16]
Can we get Jevin back? 

Kelly Somers [00:46:17]
Yeah. Come on then. So those are the top two, I'd guess. Who's going to be the third, Jules. Not any of those. 

Julien Laurens [00:46:24]
No, no. Watkins maybe, obviously. I just. I don't know if Ollie Watkins can have another season at 20 plus and 20 plus goals and ten plus assists. I would love him to. I think the Champions League is going to take a lot of energy out of those Aston Villa players. And not just energy, everything. The focus, the excitement, everything physically, mentally, which is great for them. It's an amazing journey to go on. And this Champions League now, especially with the former, you play more games, so even better for them. But I do think that takes a lot away from you compared to the league. But yeah, I would say Watkins. I would say Watkins as well as his sack and Haaland. 

Sam Bonfield [00:47:02]
But let's be realistic, Jules, how many people are going to be able to afford those three as their forwards? 

Julien Laurens [00:47:07]
Like nobody I know, but that's not what we do. We're just saying the best pick. 

Sam Bonfield [00:47:11]
Yeah, I know, but I just think that, like, in my mind, I agree on all of those three being great picks, but I just think that there's some such nice value picks as well. Like Jar Pedro is back in training. I think he, if he regularly starts, and that's the thing that we missed last season. 

Julien Laurens [00:47:28]
I don't think I understood this game at all. I really have prepared for it. I just did. I don't think I understood. 

Kelly Somers [00:47:35]
Should we blame. I'll tell you what, guys, we'll blame the question master I should have been. Because Jules, you both interpreted it in a different way. You've just picked your best three midfielders in the game. I get it. And Sam has done it. 

Julien Laurens [00:47:45]
The best midfielder regardless of price. 

Kelly Somers [00:47:48]
Whereas Sam has tried to help out every manager. 

Julien Laurens [00:47:51]
It's another show we need. I thought it was a quick fire. Okay, goalkeeper. Bim, bim, bim, defender. 

Kelly Somers [00:47:56]
Instead it was meant to be quick fire and it never. 

Sam Bonfield [00:48:00]
Blame me. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:01]
No, blame me. We could have done a whole podcast just on that thing. Especially with your argument. You know what? We haven't given producer Jessie a shout out. We need to give him one now because I am getting messages to say, please, please hurry up. 

Sam Bonfield [00:48:11]
Can I just talk about progesterone for a minute? 

Kelly Somers [00:48:13]
Progesterone? Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. 

Sam Bonfield [00:48:14]
Because last night he messaged me whilst he was setting up his first draft team. So he was having a go at Jules last week for not having done his right. 

Julien Laurens [00:48:24]
He was in France on holidays, and. 

Sam Bonfield [00:48:26]
Last night he was building his draft. And then he sent me a draft and I was like, it's got no Harlan in it. And then two minutes later, he sent me a link to the Chelsea game in preseason where Harlan scored a hat trick. He was like, I need to do it all again, don't I? I was like, yes, Jesse, off you go. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:41]
He might cut that out because we're now over on time. Maybe he'll cut that out. 

Sam Bonfield [00:48:44]
He's got to keep it. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:45]
Yeah. 

Julien Laurens [00:48:46]
And also a big shout out. I wanted to say to this lovely family from Howergate in England who are big fans of the show and of talent, vision and planning. So, you know, it was lovely. 

Kelly Somers [00:48:55]
Explain how you know that. 

Julien Laurens [00:48:56]
You know, we were on the same tube together and we had a lovely chat and it was great. And, yeah, they were a lovely family enjoying the Olympics. So I hope that your trip in Paris is still very good. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:08]
I'm sure they've got a lot better since they met you. Jules, did you give them some FPL tips? 

Julien Laurens [00:49:11]
Yeah, a little bit. And they're going with that. Well, the little boys going without Holland, for example, you know, the Liverpool. I know. That's brave. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:19]
Really brave. Okay, well, shout outs complete. Jules, what Olympic sport have you got for us? People have been watching. Come on, man. 

Julien Laurens [00:49:26]
This time to see one that's sprinting obviously javelin. You know, I can do the shop if you. I can do the high jump because, you know, me and Dick Fosberry were good friends. Like, this is not diving. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:44]
We're going to end this here. Right. 

Julien Laurens [00:49:45]
You know, jumping. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:46]
Jesse's just messaged me saying, can you describe what he's doing? Because this doesn't work very well for audio. So he's running a bit. The first one was hands going wild by reporter. 

Sam Bonfield [00:49:56]
I meant to be able to test. 

Kelly Somers [00:49:58]
Say what I see. 

Julien Laurens [00:49:58]
That's why, you know, the Olympics. 

Sam Bonfield [00:50:00]
This is why you're not a commentator. 

Kelly Somers [00:50:01]
Kelly, have you seen the technique on this guy? He's kind of running with his arms up and down. Now he's going in slow mode. That's him sprinting. Do you javelin again? Javelin. Always forgotten how to throw. 

Julien Laurens [00:50:13]
The footwork first, but you can't see the footwork. 

Kelly Somers [00:50:16]
But I can't see his feet. And then he tried to launch something from behind his arm. Is that everything? Shot puts really in there under his shoulder. He's really bit too tight on the arm. Believe it or not, when I was at school, I did the shot put jog. 

Julien Laurens [00:50:28]
A lot of the listeners, when you watch the Olympics, you really believe you can do well in a lot of those sports. Obviously you can't. 

Kelly Somers [00:50:33]
I think when you watch this back, you'll realize you can't. 

Julien Laurens [00:50:36]
Oh my God. 

Kelly Somers [00:50:38]
Anyway, Sam, go on quickly. 

Sam Bonfield [00:50:41]
No, just, if you listen to this as a podcast, just go and watch the last couple of minutes of this on YouTube because it's very difficult to explain. 

Julien Laurens [00:50:47]
I mean, this was impressive. 

Sam Bonfield [00:50:49]
I thought at least, at least next time we record, he won't be at the Olympics anymore. 

Kelly Somers [00:50:53]
No. Yeah. When is the next time? Was it next week? The Olympics are over. You never know when the show is until the day before. You'll be back in England. Don't worry. You're gonna be in England. 

Julien Laurens [00:51:02]
No, no, I'll be in England. 

Kelly Somers [00:51:03]
Oh, what a privilege. Okay, I'm gonna leave it here now because we've gone way, way over watching George. George? Who's George? Oh gosh, I've lost my head. George has been doing multi sports. At the end of this podcast, guys, remember to get your team sorted. You've got just over a week to go. Let's just end it here. Thanks for listening. If you're watching, why on earth would you do it yourself? See you soon, guys.
